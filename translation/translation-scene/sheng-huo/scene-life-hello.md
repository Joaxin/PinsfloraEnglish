# 问候

### Hello

There are a bunch of things that you can do to make your day \(and someone else's\) more interesting, even with something as small as how you greet them! A simple “hello” normally does the trick, but maybe you want to switch it up a bit.

#### Just Say “Hi!”

It seems with more and more technology flooding our markets, we are becoming out-of-tune with the world around us—people in particular.

You might have noticed that people would rather stare down at their phones, pretending to do something important, or even make brief eye contact then stare away as you pass by, all in an effort to avoid saying something so simple as a greeting. This is not even just for total strangers, but acquaintances alike! It’s a common courtesy that is slowly slipping away as we indulge in social media and in a virtual world where we get so used to talking to people electronically that we forget how to do it face-to-face. We need to break this cycle of utter social awkwardness!

I don’t know about you, but when a friendly stranger simply smiles and says “hello” as they walk by, it makes my day better.

Don’t be that person who pretends not to see the people walking by. Be social, be happy, make your day better with real interaction while you also brighten up someone else's! If you are bored with saying “hello,” here are a few ways to mix it up!

#### Funny Greeting Tips to Try

Nearly any greeting can be funny if you say it the right way! Here are a few handy tips to try to ensure you amuse your amigo!

* **Accents:** Add a silly accent to your greeting. \(Erro! G'day, mate!\) Your friend will simply smile and probably call you a dork, but the smile was worth it, right?
* **Silly voices:** Who doesn't like silly voices and sounds? Try a few out. If you have a kid yourself, you know what noises you'll make to get a smile!
* **Impersonations:** If you do any impersonations, that'll make your greeting extra amusing, even more so if it's a lousy impersonation!
* **Jokes:** Start the conversation with a joke! Imagine answering the phone and hearing this: "How do you call a fish? You drop it a line!"
* **Foreign** **languages:** Switch it up by answering your mom's phone call with a little French or Japanese! It'll leave her confused, that's for sure! \(More on these later!\)

#### Saying Hello to Kids

* Howdy, partner!
* Hey, howdy, hi!
* What’s kickin’, little chicken?
* Peek-a-boo!
* Howdy-doody!
* Hey there, freshman!
* My name's Ralph, and I'm a bad guy.
* Hi, mister!
* I come in peace!

#### Saying Hello to Your Love

With a significant other, anything goes as long as you are not disrespectful. If they don’t marry you because of how you say hello, well, then they are not the one for you.

* ‘Ello, mate.
* Heeey, baaaaaby.
* Hi, honeybunch!
* Oh, yoooouhoooo!
* How you doin'
* I like your face.
* What's cookin', good lookin'?
* Howdy, miss.
* Why, hello there!
* Hey, boo.

#### "Hello" in Other Languages

* Aloha: Hawaiian
* Hola: Spanish
* Que pasa: Spanish
* Bonjour: French
* Hallo: German
* Ciao: Italian
* Konnichiwa: Japanese

### Have a Nice day

 "Have a nice day." isn't a greeting: it's used for farewells.

Here are some alternatives: "Have a\(n\) nice/good/great/wonderful/excellent/fantastic/brilliant/exciting/fine/successful day." Not all of these mean the same and some are more natural than others. Place any adjective you want where needed, these are just suggestions.

"Have a good one." I don't think this is common outside Australia. Can someone confirm this?

"I wish you a day." This is more formal.

"Ejnjoy." or "Have a good time." Only used when the other person is doing some kind of activity. This isn't constrained by time, so you could use it if the other person is about to see a movie or go on a six month exchange.

"Enjoy your day." Same as the original.

Other ways you can say goodbye: "Goodbye." or "Bye." They need a mention.

"So long." or "See you later/next time." Both mean the same thing, except the latter is more casual.

"Good night." Only used at night ie. late evening or early morning.

"See you soon/shortly."

"Farewell." Very formal and not common nowadays.

"LIve long and prosper." The only other thing I can think of. This is only used jokingly.

I am now grown, and quite serious, and typically hyper-articulate. But sometimes, when I find something a little funny, I indicate pleasure with an improbable portmanteau like this one, and I feel again that I am young, and excited, and waiting to get online.

titter 窃笑,短促而神经质的笑 chortle 哈哈大笑 guffaw狂笑,而且常常只几个人起哄时一起狂笑

How is language evolving on the Internet? In this series on internet linguistics, Gretchen McCulloch breaks down the latest innovations in online communication.

We can't actually hear someone chortle \(guffaw titter burst into laughter\) through the internet, but we still want to express our emotions. Luckily, internet residents have come up with a whole slew of ways to convey laughter online—here are 15 of them. Which ones do you use?

**1. LOL**

The classic acronym for laughing out loud \(it may once have meant "lots of love" or "little old lady," but it doesn't anymore\). However, _lol_ has been around [long enough now](http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/05/23/lol_s_25th_anniversary_origins_of_still_popular_internet_abbreviation_trace.html) that it doesn't really mean out-loud laughter either—linguist John McWhorter says[it now indicates empathy](http://www.ted.com/talks/john_mcwhorter_txtng_is_killing_language_jk?language=en). For genuine laughter, make sure to emphasize it somehow: all-caps _LOL_ is a good start, or try one of the longer variants below. \(Lol doesn't count as emphasis; it's probably just autocorrect.\)

**2. OTHER SPELLINGS OF LOL**

When we treat _lol_ as just a word rather than an acronym, it means that we can change things about the letters just to indicate a different pronunciation, and without trying to come up with something they stand for. Changing the vowel, as in _lel_ and _lawl_, indicates a more laid-back, less-laugh-y response, whereas repeating part of the word, as in _lollll_ and_lololol_, indicates more actual laughter. And the combination of all-caps and reduplication—LOLOLOLOL—is the most likely to be genuine laughter of all the lol-variants, the more -OLs the better.

**3. OTHER LAUGHTER ACRONYMS**

It's not just lol—there are other acronyms indicating laughter, such as _lmao_, _lmfao_, _rotfl_, _rotflol_ for _laughing my ass off_, _rolling on the floor laughing \(out loud\)_, and of course they can also be capitalized for emphasis. _Lmao_and _lmfao_ are still relatively common, but while _ROTFLOL_ had a [great cameo in Weird Al's "White and Nerdy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9qYF9DZPdw&feature=youtu.be&t=1m50s)," it and _rotfl_ have gotten rarer.

**4. WORDS MADE FROM LOL**

_Lollerskates_, _lollercoaster_, _loltastic_, _roflcopter_—these words are fantastically creative, but like _rofl_, they ring "vintage early 2000s" to me. Perhaps they're due for an ironic revival? Another expansion is _lulz_, but it's more of a noun than an emotive response: you can do something _for the lulz_ or say that _much lulz were had_.

**5. HAHA**

Another classic laughter expression that, like _lol_, has weakened through repeated use. Plain _haha_ or autocorrected _Haha_ are sufficient for mild amusement, but for true laughter, go for all-caps _HAHA_ or one of the expansions below.

**6. EXPANSIONS OF HAHA**

You can go shorter, for less amusement \(_ha_, _aha_, _heh_\), or longer, for greater amusement \(_hahahaha_, _bahaha_, _ahaha_\). You can also vary the consonant \(_bahaha_, _gahaha_\) or the vowel \(_heh_, _hehe_, _heehee_\). Typos, like _ahha_ or _hahahaah_, may indicate you're laughing too hard to type properly. Caps, as ever, for emphasis. Combining them is not common \(I've never seen **behehe\* or** ahehahe\* or _\*abaha_, and even BAHAHA is rarer than HAHAHA\).

**7. EVIL LAUGHTER**

Fairly straightforward: evil or mock-evil is expressed as a variant on _mwahaha_ or _muahahah_, with the usual caveats about reduplication of _ha_and all-caps for emphasis.

**8. HAHA IN OTHER LANGUAGES**

Other languages use repetitions of different symbols, such as Spanish _jajajaja_ \(that's the "j" sound as in _jalapeño_\), Thai _5555_ \(the number 5 is pronounced _ha_\), or Korean _ㅋㅋㅋㅋ_ \(pronounced _kkkk_—vowels are only written for louder laughter\). A few languages also have their own acronyms, such as French _mdr_ \(_mort de rire_ "dying of laughter"\).

**9. THIRD PERSON NARRATION**

You can also choose to transcribe what you're doing in the third person, almost as if you were giving stage directions of yourself. Some platforms may automatically turn _g_ into a "grins" emoji, but you can also write longer versions like _laughs_ or _laughs uncontrollably_ or _spits water on keyboard_. This style is less common with laughter though, and more common with emotions that are hard to draw and don't have onomatopoeia, such as _sighs heavily_ or &lt;\sarcasm&gt; or \#headdesk.

**10. O**

**555**

the equvilant of "hahaha" in english used by thai ppl online. In Thai "ha" means 5. Thus, hahaha = 555

“Haha” or “lol”? Whether you’re an enthusiastic user of every [messaging app](http://www.cheatsheet.com/gear-style/messaging-apps-android-ios.html/) and social network under the sun, or only recently downloaded Snapchat to see what the fuss is about, you probably have a preferred method of conveying laughter in a text or a post. Maybe you’re a “haha” person, and will add more “ha”s as the texts or posts get funnier. Maybe you prefer “hehe,” and tend to use restraint when adding extra syllables. Or perhaps you always type “lol,” and can’t imagine yourself doing anything else.

Or maybe you’re the type of person who doesn’t express your laughter in writing, neither in messages to friends or in social media posts that wider groups of people will see. On the other hand, perhaps you think that written laughter helps others recognize the lighter tone of a message, even if you rarely use such expressions yourself. Or maybe you’re secretly annoyed at everybody who appends messages with “haha” or “hehe,” or the dreaded “HAHAHAHAHAHA.”

Maybe you think that the entire thing is undignified. Perhaps it’s your silent judgment that everybody is either too lazy to properly express their appreciation of a joke or comment, or everybody is wasting far too much time adding and subtracting syllables from words that don’t even remotely approximate the sound of real human laughter.

Regardless of where you come down on the issue, it’s hard to deny that the language that we choose when firing off short missives to one another is interesting. Sarah Larson reports for the New Yorker that “the terms of e-laughter — ‘ha ha,’ ‘ho ho,’ ‘hee hee,’ ‘heh’ — are implicitly [understood by just about everybody](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/hahaha-vs-hehehe).”

### “Ha,” “haha,” “hahaha,” or “hahahaha”?

![Businessman texting using a smartphone and holding a paper cup](https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Man-texting-on-phone-640x425.jpg)

Do you text with “ha” or “haha”? \| iStock.com/Ridofranz

In Larson’s assessment, a single “ha” is the “basic unit of written laughter.” Typing “ha” is usually regarded as a hat tip to a joke or an observation that you don’t really think is hilarious. “Haha,” on the other hand, is what Larson characterizes as a respectful laugh. “Hahaha” means that you’re really amused. And any more than three “ha”s is the appropriate response to “a scandalous remark, a zinger, a gut laugh, the high-grade stuff.”

Larson instructs readers to be judicious about all-caps, as this may indicate “how violently you’re laughing and how sane you are,” and advises that in fits of enthusiastic laughter, exclamation points are often superfluous. She also has some words of advice about alternatives to “ha” in all its permutations. “Heh” is an acknowledgment for a good point. “Ho ho” is an appropriate response to a bad joke. “Hee hee” is, in Larson’s assessment, “cute and conspiratorial.” But “tee hee,” on the other hand, is potentially too cute. “Hehe”s are, to Larson, a “strange mystery” — likely the mischievous “hee hee” slightly shortened in an odd but common misspelling. But she noted, wisely, that usage and interpretation of e-laughter terms tends to vary by age and gender.

Facebook data scientists Udi Weinsberg, Lada Adamic, and Mike Develin read Larson’s piece, and sought to catalog the usage of “not-so-universal [language of laughter](https://research.facebook.com/blog/the-not-so-universal-language-of-laughter/)” on the world’s most popular social network. They reported that 15% of people included laughter in a post or a comment in a week on Facebook. The most common usage on Facebook is “haha,” followed by various emoji, and then by “hehe.” Age, gender, and geographic location play a role in laughter type and length, with the researchers reporting that young people and women prefer emoji. Men prefer longer “hehe”s. People in Chicago and New York prefer emoji. And those in Seattle and San Francisco prefer “haha”s.

### “Haha” vs. “hehe” vs. “lol”

![Man texts using his smartphone](https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/In-station-hall-a-man-using-cell-phone-640x426.jpg)

Depending on your gender and location, you may be more likely to use a certain e-laugh over another \| iStock.com

The majority of users \(51.4%\) in the researchers’ data set used “haha” or its variants. While 33.7% used emoji, only 12.7% used “hehe” or its variants. And finally, just 1.9% used “lol.” In terms of variations, the researchers found that the most common are the four-letter “haha” and “hehe.” The six-letter “hahaha” is also quite common. In general, users who pick “haha” tend to use longer laughter. Haha-ers are also a little more open to using an odd number of letters than those who choose “hehe.” On the other hand, “lol” almost always stands by itself. But the researchers did find some “rare specimens” of “lolz” and “loll.”

Even though “haha” is more popular on Facebook than alternatives like “hehe” or “lol,” that doesn’t mean that the same is true across all social networks and online communities. FiveThirtyEight notes that “haha” has been [significantly more popular](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-favorite-examples-of-how-the-internet-talks-on-reddit/) in Reddit comments since late 2007 than alternatives like “hahaha,” “heh,” “hah,” “hehe,” “hahahaha,” and “hahahahaha.” But “lol” has been [much more popular](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/reddit-ngram/?keyword=haha.lol&start=20071015&end=20150831&smoothing=10) than “haha” in the same period of time on the site. It’s worth noting that Reddit users are mostly 35 or younger and 80% male — a much more specific demographic than Facebook’s broad user base.

So, if your preferred method of text-laugh places you in the minority on your social network of choice, should you change your ways and adopt a more common mode of e-laughter? Probably not. \(You wouldn’t change your real-life laugh, so why conform to the norm with your text laughter? That may make you worse than those who type “hahahahahahahaha” with no sign of stopping, or choose the slightly obnoxious “lolz,” or type everything in ALL CAPS.\) Ellie Kemper writes for McSweeney’s that she had [no plans to stop](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/i-have-no-plans-to-stop-using-ahahahahahaha-instead-of-lol-anytime-soon) using “ahahahahahaha” instead of “lol,” despite pressure from friends and colleagues. She writes, “Here’s the thing about ‘lol’: What in the hell does that even mean? That I’m _laughing out loud_? Yeah, that really comes across when I’m reading it.”

### Yes

The word _yes_ is great and all … but there’s plenty of other ways you can offer someone a verbal go-ahead. So if you feel like dipping your toes into the wild waters of alternative affirmations, then take a gander at the list below. If you’re feeling brave, deploy an _aye aye_ in a business meeting or let loose a _fo’ shizzle_ when someone asks if you’d like to go grab an ice cream. Let’s have a look at other ways to say yes!

#### 1. yes

You can probably do better than this most standard of affirmations. The word _yes_, by the way, is exactly as old as you’d expect, dating all the way back to the Old English _gēse_, _gīse_, probably from an unrecorded phrase meaning ‘may it be so’.

#### 2. yea

If you want to inject an archaic flavour into your response, then give _yea_ a try. It’s also used as the response for an affirmative vote in the US Congress, so you can feel legislative as well as archaic!

#### 3. OK

Referred to by some as America’s greatest contribution to the English language, _OK_ has a [long and complicated history](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/what-is-the-origin-of-the-word-ok).

#### 4. okey-dokey

The goofy younger brother of _OK, okey-dokey_ is a surefire way to offer ad laidback, jokey affirmative.

#### 5. by all means

By which means? All of them! This imploring affirmative suggests that ‘yes’ is being offered in every way possible. Don’t forget about its negating cousin, _by no means_.

#### 6. affirmative

One way to give an affirmation is, well, to just say _affirmative_! Largely a North American interjection, _affirmative_ is also heard in the phrase ‘in the affirmative’, as in ‘you answered _in the affirmative_ when I asked about that ice cream’.

#### 7. aye aye

You can almost hear the waves and taste the salty breeze when you use this one. This seaworthy affirmation is often heard in the fuller ‘aye aye, Captain’. Of course, the shorter _aye_ is more common, but far less seaworthy \(and, well, fun\).

#### 8. roger

In radio communication, _roger_ is used to acknowledge receipt of a message. In extended use, though, we’ve been deploying _roger_ for quite some time. ‘Can you go grab me an ice cream?’ ‘Roger!’

#### 9. 10-4

If you’ve got that hankering for a radio reference, but _roger_ doesn’t quite suit you, then consider the brisk and official _10-4_, which is part of the ‘ten-code’, the code of signals \(all beginning with the number 10\) originally used in police radio communication in the US and later adopted by Citizens’ Band radio operators. The phrase means ‘message received’.

#### 10. uh-huh

The quintessential verbalized shrug, _uh-huh_ conveys assent, but is also one of the more noncommittal ways to say yes.

#### 11. righto

Ah! Here’s an especially British way to go about it. Of course, you can leave off the ‘o’ on the end and leave it at ‘right!’, but how chipper does that sound in comparison? Not at all as chipper.

#### 12. very well

Both _very well_ and _very good_ convey a flavour of acceptance rather than excitement. Can you hear that slight note of exasperation? ‘Oh, very well then, come inside …’

#### 13. yup

_Yup_ and its variation _yep_ are such a joy to say because they all have that delightful plosive ‘p’.

#### 14. yuppers

_Yuppers_ \(and its cousin _yeppers_\) boldly go for the extension. Perhaps best used when it comes to childish pursuits, as in: ‘You want _more_ cotton candy?!’ ‘Yuppers!’

#### 15. right on

Feeling an overwhelming sense of approval? Then we recommend the hearty _right on_ as a rejoinder.

#### 16. ja

Used in South African English \(drawn from Dutch\), this ‘yes’ interjection is also found in German. This raucous affirmation is also sometimes spelled _yah_.

#### 17. surely

Besides guiding the conversation straight into a thicket of _Airplane!_ references, _surely_ also does a fine job of imparting enthusiastic assent.

#### 18. amen

Want to insert a little religious flavour into your response? Have a go with _amen_, which goes all the way back to the Hebrew word _āmēn_, meaning ‘truth, certainty’. Usually uttered at the end of a prayer or hymn, meaning ‘so be it’, _amen_ is also used to express agreement or assent, sometimes in the form _amen to that_.

#### 19. fo’ shizzle

Do you dare? If you’re feeling gutsy, drop _fo’ shizzle_ into your lexicon. Be warned, though, that _shizzle_ on its own is typically a euphemism for ‘shit’. The response _for_ \(or _fo’_\) _shizzle_, on the other hand, is roughly equivalent to _for sure_ or _definitely._

#### 20. totally

You might risk sounding a little spaced-out with this one, but it’s so _totally_ worth the attempt.

#### 21. sure

This is the response for someone who hemmed and hawed, but came down on the ‘yes’ side eventually.

#### 22. yessir

Gender of the addressee aside, this reply can offer either deep-seated respect or canny insubordination.

### No

Sometimes you need somebody to get the point, and a simple _no_ won’t do it. We’ve taken a look through the Historical Thesaurus of the _OED_ and other sources to find out how best to say no to something. Now you can say _no_ daily for almost a whole month without repeating yourself \(and then you can start using [22 ways to](http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2015/10/ways-to-say-yes/) _yes\)._

#### 1. no

Let’s start with the easy one. _No_ dates to Old English, unsurprisingly; a corresponding _o_ \(meaning ‘ever; always’\) is now obsolete.

#### 2. uh-uh

The imitative _uh-uh_ is first found in its written form in the 1920s.

#### 3. nix

Originally Victorian slang, _nix_ can be compared with the earlier German _nix_, which is a colloquial shortened form of _nichts_ \(‘nothing’\).

#### 4. nixie / nixy / nixey

And it wasn’t long until this slang term was given a _–y/-ie_ suffix, used to form pet names and familiar diminutives.

#### 5. nope

The earliest sense of _nope_ \(albeit an unrelated word spelled the same\) was actually another name for the bullfinch, used in the early 17th century – but fast forward to the the late 19th century and _nope_ is being used for _no_, with an apparently arbitrary extension, at around the same time that _yep_ began being used for _yes_.

#### 6. nay

This form of _no_ is particularly characteristic of Northern English. In origin it is a borrowing from early Scandinavian \(cf. Icelandic _nei_\). You could once also _nick with nay_ – that is, ‘answer in the negative’. Saying _nay_ to somebody might well nick them \(in the sense ‘give a small scratch’\), but people haven’t been using this expression much since the 14th century.

#### 7. nah

A non-standard spelling of _no_, _nah_ is often used when representing southern English pronunciation, particularly cockney speech

#### 8. no way

Though decried as slang by some, _no way_ \(for ‘no’\) has a long history, dating back at least as far as the 18th century.

#### 9. no way, José

It’s not entirely clear why _José_ is added to this expression, other than the obvious novelty of the rhyme. Its history \(unsurprisingly\) is far shorter, with the current earliest known use dating only to 1979.

#### 10. negative

If you’re feeling in a military frame of mind, you can say _negative_ instead of _no_ \(as opposed to _affirmative_ for _yes_\). This probably started as a way of saying ‘no’ over the radio with as much clarity as possible.

#### 11. veto

_Veto_ joins that group of Latin words \(including _et cetera_, _ad hoc_, and _per se_\) that are used as everyday parts of English. Literally translating as ‘I forbid’, this is a fairly commanding way to show your disapproval of a scheme.

#### 12. out of the question

Originally meaning ‘beside the point, not relevant to the matter under discussion’ – that is, outside the parameters of the matter in question – this took on the meaning ‘not to be considered or countenanced’. One of the earliest uses of this later sense comes from Eliza Haywood’s _The History of Betsy Thoughtless_: ‘A marriage with miss Betsy was, therefore, now quite out of the question with him’.

#### 13. no siree

You would be right in thinking that _siree_ here is derived from _sir_ — ultimately it is, but it developed as a variant of _sirrah_ \(much used in Shakespeare\), which \(in turn\) was formed directly from _sir_ with a \(perhaps arbitrary\) suffix, as a term used when addressing men or boys with contempt.

#### 14. for foul nor fair

Putting opposites together to cover a spectrum is a pretty good way to indicate that something isn’t going to happen: this one can be found as far back as Chaucer’s _Canterbury Tales_.

#### 15. not on your life

This emphasizes your reluctance to comply with a request – that, even if the requester’s life was at stake, you’d still be a hard pass.

#### 16. not on your Nelly

The British expression _not on your Nelly_, in its earliest incarnation in a 1941 issue of the _New Statesman_, appears as _not on your Nelly Duff_. Though the identity of the original Ms Duff is disputed, _Nelly Duff_ was Cockney rhyming slang for _puff_, i.e. the breath of life. So _not on your Nelly_ is just another way of saying _not on your life_.

#### 17. not on your tintype

A _tintype_ was a photograph taken as a positive on a thin tin plate but also found its way into this phrase, which dates to at least 1900.

#### 18. not for all the tea in China

This phrase, despite drawing on Britain’s national obsession, is actually originally from colloquial Australian English.

#### 19. not in a million years

If the tea in China doesn’t seem like enough of a hyperbolic reward, try exaggerating the length of time you need for debate. People haven’t been using it for quite a million years, but it certainly dates back over a century.

#### 20. under no circumstances

For avoidance of doubt, this one pretty much covers all bases. _Circumstance_ was originally a noun of action or condition, in the singular, but is now usually pluralized.

#### 21. not likely

Although you’re probably in complete control of the likelihood or otherwise of something happening if you say _not likely_, it’s an option for dismissing someone’s suggestion with a bit of sass.

#### 22. not for Joe

The phrase _not for Joe_, meaning ‘not on any account’, dates from the mid-19th century and appears to use _Joe_ as a non-specific person \(although the phrase may have originally arisen from the name of the 18th-century comedian Joe Miller, and a popular jest-book published after his death.

#### 23. thumbs down

Turning the thumb down is, of course, a gesture intended to indicate disapproval or rejection – and the term can be used figuratively for the same thing; i.e. a substitute for _no_ – but it’s got a somewhat muddled history. The earliest uses of _thumbs down_ and _thumbs up_ relate to ‘the use of the thumb by the spectators in the ancient amphitheatre’ – but in these instances, _thumbs up_ would indicate rejection.

#### 24. pigs might fly

Pigs \(we hate to break it to you\) don’t fly, and _pigs might fly_, _pigs have wings_, and similar expressions are used to indicate impossibility or incredulity. The first known use, in this way, of pig’s grounded behaviour is not quite synonymous with _no_ – but has the distinction of being found in _Alice’s Adventures of Wonderland_: ‘‘I’ve a right to think,’ said Alice sharply… ‘Just about as much right,’ said the Duchess, ‘as pigs have to fly.’’

#### 25. not a cat \(in hell\)’s chance

If you think the pig did badly, the cat fares even worse: as far back as Grose’s _Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue_ in 1796, he cited ‘No more chance than a cat in hell without claws; said of one who enters into a dispute or quarrel with one greatly above his match’. Its application now is, of course, rather wider than disputers and quarrellers.

#### 26. fat chance

_Fat chance_ is an ironic use of the adjective _fat_ in its sense ‘a large amount, a great deal’. Interestingly, this sense seems only to be used ironically, implying ‘very little, hardly anything’.

#### 27. catch me!

_Catch me!_ and _catch me at it!_ are also suggestive of their opposite: that is, that the interlocutor would never be able to catch the person at it, since it \(whatever ‘it’ is\) wouldn’t happen. The sense of _catch_being used is ‘to come upon suddenly or unexpectedly’, which is also still used in sentences such as ‘I catch myself speaking like my mother’.

#### 28. no fear

_Fear_ here originally meant ‘ground or reason for alarm’, though even in its earliest uses \(including a 16th-century translation of _Psalms_\) it appeared chiefly in _\(there is\) no fear_ – that is, that there is no grounds for alarm. The usual sense now is as an informal but definite _no_.

#### 29. go fish

_Go fish_ is an American card game, usually played by children, in which each player in turn asks an opponent for a particular card and is told to ‘go fish’ from the undealt deck if denied. The term has taken on broader use as a playful way of saying _no_.

### Interjections you should be using

Perhaps the wildest of all the parts of speech, the interjection accounts for a fun swath of the English language, including curse words, expressions of joy, greetings, and even pseudo-magical incantations. In this post, I take a look at interjections we should all probably be using more often. Some of them you’ve probably heard before, but others will probably be new. Before you know it – _bada bing!_ – we might be hearing these terms everywhere.

#### 1. [abracadabra](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/abracadabra)

Although _abracadabra_ – a word spoken by conjurors while performing a trick – might sound like a goofy invention of the 20th century, the word actually goes all the way to post-classical Latin at the end of the 4th century. Other magical interjections include _alakazam_ and _shazam_.

#### 2. Abyssinia

If you’re parting from someone and feeling punny, you might consider deploying ‘Abyssinia’, the former European name of the country in northeastern Africa now called Ethiopia. _Abyssinia!_, of course, is shorthand for _I’ll be seeing you!_

#### 3. [ahoy](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ahoy)

Alexander Graham Bell would indeed be pleased if _ahoy!_ were to come into vogue. Bell, the inventor of the telephone, originally suggested that _ahoy_ be used when answering the phone as a greeting. \(Bell, of course, didn’t invent the word; _ahoy_ comes from nautical slang of the mid-18th century.\) Thomas Edison is popularly credited with introducing _hello_ as the alternative greeting and popularizing the use of the word as a general greeting; _ahoy_, on the other hand, never saw widespread acceptance.

#### 4. [aloha](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/aloha)

Is there anything better than the word _aloha_? This multitalented Hawaiian word can be used both as a greeting and a farewell, as well as ‘good wishes’, ‘love’, or ‘affection’. The word derives from the same source as the Maori word _aroha_, which means ‘love, affection, pity’.

#### 5. [bada bing](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/bada-bing)

Used to ‘emphasize that something will happen effortlessly and predictably’, this word was popularized by Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 film _The Godfather_: ‘You’ve gotta get up close like this and bada-bing! you blow their brains all over your nice Ivy League suit’. The word may have originated in imitation of the sound of a drum roll and cymbal clash.

#### 6. bahala na

From Tagalog, this term in Philippine English expresses an attitude of ‘optimistic acceptance or fatalistic resignation, especially in acknowledging that the outcome of an uncertain or difficult situation is beyond one’s control or is preordained’. In this way, it is quite similar to _que sera sera_, ‘what will be, will be’. _Bahala na_ is a shortened version of _bahala na ang Diyos_ meaning ‘God will take care of it’.

#### 7. [banzai](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/banzai)

Probably best known to English speakers for its use in World War II as a Japanese battle cry, the word _banzai_ originally was used as a form of greeting to the Japanese emperor. The word _banzai_ literally means ‘ten thousand years \(of life to you\)’.

#### 8. blood and thunder

Expressing anger or exasperation, _blood and thunder_ would be outdated if you used it today, but it does pack a nice 18th century punch if you’re conversing with a literature student.

#### 9. chug-a-lug

Next time you’re in the pub and someone is being slow with a drink, you can forget the curt, rather typical _chug!_ and try out the fuller _chug-a-lug!_ Bonus points for loosely referencing an [old country song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ylv1_FEXvLM).

#### 10. [cowabunga](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cowabunga)

Although the word comes with some baggage – it was first popularized as the cry of Chief Thunderthud on the US television show _Howdy Doody_ – it remains a fun word, usually used to humorously express delight or satisfaction. Besides its appearances on _Howdy Doody_, the word was frequently heard on _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ as the catchphrase of Michelangelo.

#### 11. dagnabbit

Often appearing in stereotyped characterization of US rural speech, _dagnabbit_ is a euphemistic alternation coming from ‘darn it’ and ultimately from ‘God damn it’.

#### 12. [eureka](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/eureka)

One of the most famous interjections of all time, _eureka_ comes from the Greek _heurēka_ \(‘I have found it’\), and was uttered by Archimedes upon his discovery of how to determine the purity of gold. Reportedly, Archimedes made the discovery upon stepping into a bath and noticing that the water rose; he realized that the volume of water displaced must be equal to the part of his body that was submerged. Hence, it has become a cry of joy or satisfaction upon discovering something.

#### 13. [gadzooks](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/gadzooks)

This archaic interjection of surprise or annoyance might sound goofy, but it actually has a pretty serious origin. _Gadzooks_ is an alteration of ‘God’s hooks’, referring to the nails by which Jesus was fastened to the cross. An interjection with a similar etymology is _zounds_, which comes from an alteration of ‘by God’s wounds’.

#### 14. geewhillikins

The origins of this interjection, used \(often humorously\) to express mild surprise and enthusiasm, are not clear. Some claim that it is a fanciful substitute for _Jerusalem!_, an interjection that, believe it or not, was quite popular in 19th-century US, possibly as a non-blasphemous substitute for _Jesus!_

#### 15. [Geronimo](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/geronimo#Geronimo-2)

Used as a battle cry by US paratroopers, _Geronimo_ has become by association something shouted by those making great leaps, or as a general word of exultation. The word comes from the name of an Apache Indian chief \(1829–1909\), although there is no consensus for the reasons behind this usage.

#### 16. [gesundheit](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/gesundheit)

If someone lets a sneeze rip, be more original than _bless you_: try out _gesundheit_, which means ‘health’ in German, and wishes the sneezer good health.

#### 17. [Gordon Bennett](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Gordon-Bennett)

If you’re feeling surprise, incredulity, or exasperation and sense an interjection coming on, you might consider tossing out a full name: _Gordon Bennet_. James _Gordon Bennett_ Jr. \(1841–1918\) was a U.S. publisher, editor, and sponsor of sporting events, and probably lent his name to the interjection, which may be a euphemistic substitution for _gorblimey_. \(In turn, _gorblimey_ is an alteration of ‘God blind me’.\)

#### 18. [Great Scott](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/great-scott%21?)

If you’re like me, _Great Scott_ sounds mostly like a reference to Doc Brown of the _Back to the Future_ trilogy. The interjection, which can express surprise, amazement, annoyance, or admiration, probably comes from the name of General Winfield Scott, US Army general, Commanding General of the US Army from 1841 – 1861, as an alteration of _Great God_. \(More on ‘Great Scott’ and ‘[Bob’s your uncle](http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2014/12/whats-name-bobs-uncle-curious-expressions/)’.\)

#### 19. hasta la vista

Channel another Hollywood legend \([need I tell you which one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger)?\) with _hasta la vista_. \(The _baby_ is optional.\) Of course, _hasta la vista_ is an actual borrowing from Spanish, in which the parting words literally mean ‘until the \(next\) sighting’.

#### 20. [hot diggety dog](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/hot-diggity)

Send your tongue tripping over this interjection! Expressing delight or strong approval, this is a hot contender for the goofiest interjection.

#### 21. [jolly hockey sticks](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/jolly-hockey-sticks)

This humorous interjection is mostly found in imitations of upper-class, British public school girls, and often used ironically. Currently, the _Oxford English Dictionary_ \(_OED_\) is looking for [your help](http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2015/05/oed-appeals-can-you-help-us-find-earlier-evidence-of-the-phrase-jolly-hockey-sticks/) to locate the earliest appearance of the word.

#### 22. mabuhay

From Tagalog, this Philippine English word is a salutation or greeting, and literally means ‘live’, in the sense of ‘long live \_\_\_!’ The word _viva_ is similarly used in Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese.

#### 23. mother-of-pearl

Literally, mother-of-pearl refers to the smooth, iridescent inner layer of the shell of some molluscs. Figuratively, the term has been used as an interjection expressing surprise, disbelief, or dismay. Probably a euphemism for _Mother of God_, it is considered obsolete.

#### 24. [open sesame](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/open-sesame#open-sesame)

In the tale Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, _open sesame_ – after the French _Sesame, ouvre-toi_ – is the magical phrase that opens the door to the robbers’ cave. Next time someone is about to hold open a door for you, feel free to inject some magic into the act.

#### 25. pocas palabras

Mostly found in Elizabethan, Jacobean, and Caroline English drama, the interjection _pocas palabras_ comes from Spanish \(literally ‘few words’\), and means ‘enough said’ or ‘be of few words’. Oddly, the use of this term as an interjection is not found in Spanish.

#### 26. [roger](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/roger)

Representing the letter ‘r’ for ‘received’ in radio communication \(though in today’s radio code ‘r’ is ‘romeo’\), _roger_ is used to acknowledge the receipt of a message, or to affirm that a message has been understood or accepted. For the latter use, [dad-rock fans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilco#Formation) might enjoy the military slang _wilco_ \(‘_wi_ll _co_mply’\).

#### 27. [shabash](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/shabash)

From the Urdu and Persian _šābāš_ \(from _šād_ ‘joyful’ + _bāš!_ \(imperative\) ‘be!’\), the interjection _shabash_, which appears in Indian English, means ‘well done’.

#### 28. [shazam](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/shazam)

This ‘magic’ interjection isn’t anywhere near as old as _abracadabra_. _Shazam_ dates to the first part of the 20th century, and probably originated in children’s slang. It notably appeared in an early issue of _Whiz Comics_, as the name of an old wizard who turns Billy Batson into Captain Marvel.

#### 29. tena koe

This Maori greeting, which can be found in New Zealand English, literally means ‘there you are’.

#### 30. unberufen

With _unberufen_, German once again demonstrates its propensity for coming up with useful words \(see: _Schadenfreude_\). This interjection is equivalent to the ‘touch wood’ or ‘knock on wood’ in English; it is meant to avoid an apprehended misfortune.

#### 31. vogue la galère

This interjection, which means _let’s get on with it!_ or _let’s give it a go!_, comes from French, and literally means ‘let the galley be rowed’.

#### 32. yowzer

Probably my favorite interjection, _yowzer_ is an exclamation of enthusiastic approval or affirmation. Variations include _yowsers_ and _yowza_.

#### 33. [zindabad](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/zindabad)

From the Urdu _zinda bād_ and its etymon Persian _zinda bād_, the term originated in the sense of ‘may \(he, etc.\) live!’ The interjection expresses approval and encouragement, typically specifying the thing or person in question by the preceding word or words, as in ‘Eleanor Roosevelt Zindabad!’

#### 34. [zowie](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/zowie)

_Zowie_ is an interjection expressing astonishment, generally as a reaction to a sudden or surprising act, and frequently connotes admiration.

### Goodbye

Despite their different constructions and etymologies, expressions of parting across languages tend to communicate similar things, many of them outlining the hope of meeting again. English has borrowed many of the following foreign expressions of parting, so you’ve probably encountered some of these ways to say goodbye in other languages.

#### 1. adiós, adieu, addio, adeus

Besides _adieu_ in French, there are also _adiós_ in Spanish, _addio_ in Italian, and _adeus_ in Portuguese. _Adieu_ comes from the combination of _a_ + _Dieu_ \(‘to God’\); _adios_, _addio_, and _adeus_ have similar etymologies.

#### 2. aloha

This Hawaiian word is used as both a welcome and farewell, but also for expressions of good wishes, love, and affection. Because of how often the term is used Hawaii has taken on the nickname of the Aloha State.

#### 3. arrivederci

In Italian, a_rrivederci_ means ‘until we see each other again’. You might be tempted by the _arrive-_ to think that the word has something to do with a greeting, but the word actually comes from _a_ \(‘until’\) + _rivederci_ \(‘we see each other again’\).

#### 4. ciao

_Ciao_ has an intriguing origin: in the 1920s, _ciao_ arose as a dialectal alteration of _schiavo_, which translates as ‘\(I am your\) slave’. Like _aloha_, _ciao_ does double duty as both a term of greeting and parting.

#### 5. auf Wiedersehen

A common send off in Germany is _auf Wiedersehen._ This farewell directly translates into ‘until we see again’.

#### 6. au revoir

Similar to _auf Wiedersehen, au revoir_ directly translates as ‘to the seeing again’, anticipating a meeting in the future.

#### 7. bon voyage

Another common French term with widespread usage is _bon voyage_, ‘good journey’, used to express good wishes to someone who is about to embark on a trip.

#### 8. sayonara

Short for _sayō naraba_, which literally translates as ‘if it be thus’, _sayonara_ is used, according to the _OED_, to ‘qualify desire to meet again so as not to tempt fate’. Additionally, _sayonara_ is used in English to suggest that something has been finished with, abandoned, or consigned to the past in more general usage, as in ‘you can say sayonara to that those tasty plums’.

#### 9. shalom

The Hebrew word can be used as both a welcome and farewell. _Shalom_ is the widespread Hebrew goodbye that translates as ‘peace’, but a more formal parting would be to say _shalom aleichem_ or ‘peace be with you’.

#### 10. totsiens

South Africans might send each other off by saying _totsiens_, which means ‘until we meet again’. This word entered English from Afrikaans in the 1930s, originating from Dutch words _tot_ ‘until’ and _zien_ ‘see’.

#### 11. vale

Another interesting valediction is the archaic farewell _vale_, meaning ‘goodbye’ in Latin. The word comes from the second person singular imperative of _valēre_, ‘to be well’.

#### 12. zàijiàn

A common send-off in China is 再见\(_zàijiàn_\). The verb ‘to bid farewell’ is expressed with _辞\*\*行_ _\(\*\*ɡàobié_\).

### Synonyms for fool

Do you have a foolish person in your life? Have you been searching for the perfect word to capture their sheer folly? Look no further than our list here; we have compiled some of the best words out there to describe your daft acquaintance.

#### 1. [dunce](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/dunce)

Poor John Duns Scotus … The followers of Scottish theologian and scholar Duns were considered enemies of learning by 16th-century humanists and reformers, who referred to them as ‘dunces’. So if classroom or scholarly foolishness is the sticking point, then _dunce_ is the right word for you.

#### 2. [ignoramus](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ignoramus)

‘Ignoramus’ was the endorsement given by a grand jury when they considered the prosecution’s evidence for an indictment not sufficient to warrant the case going forward. The modern sense of _ignoramus_ may come from the name of a character in George Ruggle’s 1615 comedy _Ignoramus_, which satirizes the ignorance of lawyers.

#### 3. [dullard](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/dullard)

Not only foolish, but also dull! _Dullard_ comes from the Middle Dutch word _dullaert_, from _dul_ \(‘dull’\).

#### 4. [drongo](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/drongo)

A loanword from Malagasy, this Australian and New Zealand English word refers either to a variety of songbird or to a stupid or incompetent person. The latter meaning is reputed to come from the name of an Australian racehorse of the 1920s that consistently finished last or near last in races.

#### 5. [klutz](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/klutz)

From the Yiddish word _klots_, meaning ‘wooden block’, _klutz_ refers to someone who is clumsy, awkward, or foolish. Yiddish has been a particularly fertile source of these words, including _schmuck_, _putz_, and _schlemiel_.

#### 6. \(Little\) Witham

For those inclined to puns, the several villages in Lincolnshire and Essex called ‘Witham’ offer a too-tempting opportunity to pass up. Hence, someone from ‘Little Witham’ is remarkable for their stupidity, and ‘Witham’ has been used to refer to someone ‘witless’ or a fool.

#### 7. [silly billy](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/silly-billy)

Far better if their name is William, it goes without saying.

#### 8. [nincompoop](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/nincompoop)

Nothing stings quite like this playground insult. Say it out loud to yourself – hear how hurtful those syllables are?

#### 9. poop-stick

Keeping with the _poop_ theme: if you’re feeling light-hearted, you can deploy this obscurity and be in good company. The _Oxford English Dictionary_ \(_OED_\) cites the Ian Hay and P.G. Wodehouse play _Baa, Baa, Black Sheep_ in the entry for this term: ‘I believe she really does care for that poop-stick … Fancy loving a man called Osbert Bassington-Bassington!’

#### 10. [blockhead](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/blockhead)

The _OED_ puts it best: ‘A wooden head, a wooden block for hats or wigs; hence, a head with no more intelligence in it than one of these, a blockish head’. _Ouch_.

#### 11. dunderhead

Blockhead is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to ‘head’ name-calling. There’s also the wonderful-sounding _dunderhead_, and a score of others, including _chucklehead_, _knucklehead_, _muttonhead_, _pudding-head_, _thickhead_, _airhead_, and _pinhead_.

#### 12. [dumbo](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/dumbo)

This term, which comes from the simple combination of _dumb_ + _o_, was popularized in the 1950s by the Disney film _Dumbo_. Poor cartoon elephants!
