# Meeting

First impressions are very important. So it is crucial that you leave a good impression when you first meet someone, especially if it’s for an important job, or someone who could potentially be very special to you!

第一印象非常重要。所以当你第一次见到某人时，留下一个好印象很重要，尤其是当你面对一个重要的工作或者面对某个对你来说可能非常特别的人时。

I have listed some of the most common ways to say ‘Nice to meet you’ below, and included the responses from the other person, so you know what to say, no matter whether you speak first or second!

**Formal:**

(It’s a)Pleased to meet you.

见到你很高兴。

Pleased to meet you, too.

见到你我也很高兴。

**Informal:**

It’s very nice/glad to meet you

见到你很高兴。

Nice/Glad to meet you, too.

见到你我也很高兴。

***

Lovely to meet you. / How wonderful to meet you.

见到你很高兴。/ 见到你真是太棒了。

Likewise.

我也是。

At the end of a conversation with someone you have just met, you could say the following:

在与刚认识的人交谈结束时，你可以说下面的话：

**Formal and Informal:**

It was nice meeting you.

很高兴认识你。

Nice meeting you, too.

***

很荣幸认识你。

The pleasure is mine.

荣幸的人是我。

**Informal:**

***

It was nice to have met you.

见到你真是太好了。

Me too.

我也这么想。

***

I’ve enjoyed meeting you.

我很高兴认识你。

Me too.

我也是。

Formal (This is regarded as somewhat archaic by many people nowadays, as the question isn’t answered with the reciprocal same question, but it used to be spoken as a statement, not a question (without the raised intonation at the end):

正式的（现在许多人认为这个问题有些过时，因为这个问题不是用对等的相同问题来回答，而是作为陈述来回答的，不是一个问题（结尾不是提升的语调）：

How do you do?

你好？

How do you do?

你好？

This greeting is not used in American English, it was only ever used in British English, although nowadays it seems to be nearly extinct!

这种问候语不使用在美式英语中，只在英式英语中使用过，尽管现在它似乎已经几乎绝迹了！
