Characteristics of the Renaissance Period

The word "Renaissance" is the French word for "rebirth." The Renaissance refers to the rebirth of humanism during the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries in Europe. The Renaissance period was a time of rebirth of humanism and new discoveries in fine arts, music, literature, philosophy, science and technology, architecture, religion and spirituality. Literature o In the early Renaissance, particularly in Italy, writers focused mostly on translating and studying classic Latin and Greek works. Many writers attempted to take the styles of ancient writers like Aristotle or Homer and apply them to their own works. Literature of the Renaissance focused largely on religion, classic antiquity, scholarship and politics. Sonnets also became a popular style of poetry. Some of the most famous Renaissance writers were William Shakespeare, Giovanni Boccaccio and Christopher Marlowe.

The Renaissance Period

When Constantinople fell to the hands of the Turks, many of its Greek teachers fled with their libraries to Italy and taught in Italian universities. The Englishmen who studied in Italy brought the new learning back with them to the monasteries at Oxford and Cambridge and from there Greek and Roman culture were spread to other places.
