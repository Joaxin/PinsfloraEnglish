# 纪伯伦 - 沙与沫（1926）

###  纪伯伦 - 沙与沫

> 冰心 译

我永远在沙岸上行走，

在沙土和泡沫的中间。

高潮会抹去我的脚印，

风也会把泡沫吹走。

但是海洋和沙岸

却将永远存在。

我曾抓起一把烟雾。

然后我伸掌一看，哎哟，烟雾变成一个虫子。

我把手握起再伸开一看，手里却是一只鸟。

我再把手握起又伸开，在掌心里站着一个容颜忧郁，向天仰首的人。

我又把手握起，当我伸掌的时候，除了烟雾以外，一无所有。

但是我听到了一支绝顶甜柔的歌曲。

仅仅在昨天，我认为我自己只是一个碎片，无韵律地在生命的穹苍中颤抖。

现在我晓得，我就是那穹苍，一切生命都是在我里面有韵律地转动的碎片。

他们在觉醒的时候对我说："你和你所居住的世界，只不过是无边海洋的无边沙岸上的一粒沙子。"

在梦里我对他们说："我就是那无边的海洋，大千世界只不过是我的沙岸上的沙粒。"

只有一次把我窘得哑口无言，就是当一个人问我"你是谁？"的时候。

想到神的第一个念头是一个天使。

说到神的第一个字眼是一个人。

我们是有海洋以前千万年的扑腾着、飘游着、追求着的生物，森林里的风把语言给予了我们。

那么我们怎能以昨天的声音来表现我们心中的远古年代呢？

斯芬克斯只说过一次话。斯芬克斯说："一粒沙子就是一片沙漠，一片沙漠就是一粒沙子；现在再让我们沉默下去吧。"

我听到了斯芬克斯的话，但是我不懂得。

我看到过一个女人的脸，我就看到了她所有的还未生出的儿女。

一个女人看了我的脸，她就认得了在她生前已经死去的我的历代祖宗。

我想使自己完满起来。但是除非我能变成一个上面住着理智的生物的星球，此外还有什么可能呢？

这不是每一个人的目标吗？

一粒珍珠是痛苦围绕着一粒沙子所建造起来的庙宇。

是什么愿望围绕着什么样的沙粒，建造起我们的躯体呢？

当神把我这块石子丢在奇妙的湖里的时候，我以无数的圈纹扰乱了它的表面。

但是当我落到深处的时候，我就变得十分安静了。

给我静默，我将向黑夜挑战。

当我的灵魂和肉体由相爱而结婚的时候，我就得到了重生。

从前我认识一个听觉极其锐敏的人，但是他不能说话。在一个战役中他丧失了舌头。

现在我知道在这伟大的沉默来到以前，这个人打过的是什么样的仗。我为他的死亡而高兴。

这世界为我们两个人是不够大的。

我在埃及的沙土上躺了很久，沉默着而且忘却了季节。

然后太阳把生命给了我，我起来在尼罗河岸上行走。

和白天一同唱歌，和黑夜一同做梦。

现在太阳又用一千只脚在我身上践踏，让我再在埃及的沙土上躺下。

但是，请看一个奇迹和一个谜吧！

那个把我集聚起来的太阳，不能把我打散。

我依旧挺立着，我以稳健的步履在尼罗河岸上行走。

记忆是相会的一种形式。

我们依据无数太阳的运转来测定时间；

他们以他们口袋里的小小的机器来测定时间。

那么请告诉我，我们怎能在同一的地点和同一的时间相会呢？

对于从银河的窗户里下望的人，空间就不是地球与太阳之间的空间了。

人性是一条光河，从永久以前流向永久。

难道在以太里居住的精灵，不妒羡世人的痛苦吗？

在到圣城去的路上，我遇到另一位香客，我问他："这条就是到圣城去的路吗？"

他说："跟我来吧，再有一天一夜就到达圣城了。"

我就跟随他。我们走了几天几夜，还没有走到圣城。

使我惊讶的是，他带错了路反而对我大发脾气。

神呵，让我做狮子的俘食，要不就让兔子做我的俘食吧。

除了通过黑夜的道路，人们不能到达黎明。

我的房子对我说："不要离开我，因为你的过去住在这里。"

道路对我说，"跟我来吧，因为我是你的将来。"

我对我的房子和道路说，"我没有过去，也没有将来。如果我住下来，我的住中就有去；如果我去，我的去中就有住。只有爱和死才能改变一切。"

当那些睡在绒毛上面的人所做的梦，并不比睡在土地上的人的梦更美好的时候，我怎能对生命的公平失掉信心呢？

奇怪得很，对某些娱乐的愿望，也是我的痛苦的一部分。

曾有七次我鄙视了自己的灵魂：

第一次是在她可以上升而却谦让的时候。

第二次是我看见她在瘸者面前跛行的时候。

第三次是让她选择难易，而她选了易的时候。

第四次是她做错了事，却安慰自己说别人也同样做错了事。

第五次是她容忍了软弱，而把她的忍受称为坚强。

第六次是当她轻蔑一个丑恶的容颜的时候，却不知道那是她自己的面具中之一。

第七次是当她唱一首颂歌的时候，自己相信这是一种美德。

我不知道什么是绝对的真理。但是我对于我的无知是谦虚的，这其中就有了我的荣誉和报酬。

在人的幻想和成就中间有一段空间，只能靠他的热望来通过。

天堂就在那边，在那扇门后，在隔壁的房里；但是我把钥匙丢了。

也许我只是把它放错了地方。

你瞎了眼睛，我是又聋又哑，因此让我们握起手来互相了解吧。

一个人的意义不在于他的成就，而在于他所企求成就的东西。

我们中间，有些人像墨水，有些人像纸张。

若不是因为有些人是黑的话，有些人就成了哑吧。

若不是因为有些人是白的话，有些人就成了瞎子。

给我一只耳朵，我将给你以声音。

我们的心才是一块海绵；我们的心怀是一道河水。

然而我们大多宁愿吸收而不肯奔流，这不是很奇怪吗？

当你想望着无名的恩赐，怀抱着无端的烦恼的时候，你就真和一切生物一同长大，升向你的大我。

当一个人沉醉在一个幻象之中，他就会把这幻象的模糊的情味当作真实的酒。

你喝酒为的是求醉；我喝酒为的是要从别种的醉酒中清醒过来。

当我的酒杯空了的时候，我就让它空着；但当它半满的时候，我却恨它半满。

一个人的实质，不在于他向你显露的那一面，而在于他所不能向你显露的那一面。

因此，如果你想了解他，不要去听他说出的话，而要去听他的没有说出的话。

我说的话有一半是没有意义的；我把它说出来，为的是也许会让你听到其他的一半。

幽默感就是分寸感。

当人们夸奖我多言的过失，责备我沉默的美德的时候，我的寂寞就产生了。

当生命找不到一个歌唱家来唱出她的心情的时候，她就产生一个哲学家来说出她的心思。

真理是常久被人知道的，有时被人说出的。

我们的真实的我是沉默的；后天的我是多嘴的。

我的生命内的声音达不到你的生命内的耳朵；但是为了避免寂寞，就让我们交谈吧。

当两个女人交谈的时候，她们什么话也没有说；当一个女人自语的时候，她揭露了生命的一切。

青蛙也许会叫得比牛更响，但是它们不能在田里拉犁，也不会在酒坊里牵磨，它们的皮也做不出鞋来。

只有哑巴才妒忌多嘴的人。

如果冬天说，"春天在我的心里"，谁会相信冬天呢？

每一粒种子都是一个愿望。

如果你真的睁起眼睛来看，你会从每一个形象中看到你自己的形象。

如果你张开耳朵来听，你会在一切声音里听到你自己的声音。

真理是需要我们两个人来发现的：一个人来讲说它，一个人来了解它。

虽然言语的波浪永远在我们上面喧哗，而我们的深处却永远是沉默的。

许多理论都像一扇窗户，我们通过它看到真理，但是它也把我们同真理隔开。

让我们玩捉迷藏吧。你如果藏在我的心里，就不难把你找到。但是如果你藏到你的壳里去，那么任何人也找你不到的。

一个女人可以用微笑把她的脸蒙了起来。

那颗能够和欢乐的心一同唱出欢歌的忧愁的心，是多么高贵呵。

想了解女人，或分析天才，或想解答沉默的神秘的人，就是那个想从一个美梦中挣扎醒来坐到早餐桌上的人。

我愿意同走路的人一同行走。我不愿站住看着队伍走过。

对于服侍你的人，你欠他的还不只是金子。把你的心交给他或是服侍他吧。

没有，我们没有白活。他们不是把我们的骨头堆成堡垒了吗？

我们不要挑剔计较吧。诗人的心思和蝎子的尾巴，都是从同一块土地上光荣地升起的。

每一条毒龙都产生出一个屠龙的圣乔治来。

树木是大地写上天空中的诗。我们把它们砍下造纸，让我们可以把我们的空洞记录下来。

如果你要写作（只有圣人才晓得你为什么要写作），你必须有知识、艺术和魔术——字句的音乐的知识，不矫揉造作的艺术，和热爱你读者的魔术。

他们把笔蘸在我们的心怀里，就认为他们已经得了灵感了。

如果一棵树也写自传的话，它不会不像一个民族的历史。

如果我在"写诗的能力"和"未写成诗的欢乐"之间选择的话，我就要选那欢乐。因为欢乐是更好的诗。

但是你和我所有的邻居，都一致地说我总是不会选择。

诗不是一种表白出来的意见。它是从一个伤口或是一个笑口涌出的一首歌曲。

言语是没有时间性的。在你说它或是写它的时候应该懂得它的特点。

诗人是一个退位的君王，坐在他的宫殿的灰烬里，想用残灰捏出一个形象。

诗是欢乐、痛苦和惊奇穿插着词汇的一场交道。

一个诗人要想寻找他心里诗歌的母亲的话，是徒劳无功的。

我曾对一个诗人说，"不到你死后我们不会知道你的评价。"

他回答说，"是的，死亡永远是个揭露者。如果你真想知道我的评价，那就是我心里的比舌上的多，我所愿望的比手里现有的多。"

如果你歌颂美，即使你是在沙漠的中心，你也会有听众。

诗是迷醉心怀的智慧。

智慧是心思里歌唱的诗。

如果我们能够迷醉人的心怀，同时也在他的心思中歌唱，

那么他就真个地在神的影中生活了。

灵感总是歌唱；灵感从不解释。

我们常为使自己入睡而对我们的孩子唱催眠的歌曲。

我们的一切字句，都是从心思的筵席上散落下来的残屑。

思想对于诗往往是一块绊脚石。

能唱出我们的沉默的，是一个伟大的歌唱家。

如果你嘴里含满了食物，你怎能歌唱呢？

如果你手里握满金钱，你怎能举起祝福之手呢？

他们说夜莺唱着恋歌的时候，把刺扎进自己的心膛。

我们也都是这样的。不这样我们还能歌唱吗？

天才只不过是晚春开始时节知更鸟所唱的一首歌。

连那最高超的心灵，也逃不出物质的需要。

疯人作为一个音乐家并不比你我逊色，不过他所弹奏的乐器有点失调而已。

在母亲心里沉默着的诗歌，在她孩子的唇上唱了出来。

没有不能圆满的愿望。

我和另外一个我，从来没有完全一致过。事物的实质似乎横梗在我们中间。

你的另外一个你总是为你难过。但是你的另外一个你就在难过中成长；那么就一切都好了。

除了在那些灵魂熟睡、躯壳失调的人的心里之外，灵魂和躯壳之间是没有斗争的。

当你达到生命的中心的时候，你将在万物中甚至于在看不见美的人的眼睛里，也会找到美。

我们活着只为的是去发现美。其他一切都是等待的种种形式。

撒下一粒种子，大地会给你一朵花。向天祝愿一个梦想，天空会给你一个情人。

你生下来的那一天，魔鬼就死去了。你不必经过地狱去会见天使。

许多女子借到了男子的心；很少女子能占有它。

如果你想占有，你千万不可要求。

当一个男子的手接触到一个女子的手，他俩都接触到了永在的心。

爱情是情人之间的面幕。

每一个男子都爱着两个女人：一个是他想象的作品，另外一个还没有生下来。

不肯原谅女人的细微过失的男子，永远不会欣赏她们伟大的德性。

不日日自新的爱情，变成一种习惯，而终于变成奴役。

情人只拥抱了他们之间的一种东西，而没有互相拥抱。

恋爱和疑忌是永不交谈的。

爱情是一个光明的字，被一只光明的手写在一张光明的册页上的。

友谊永远是一个甜柔的责任，从来不是一种机会。

如果你不在所有的情况下了解你的朋友，你就永远不会了解他。

你的最华丽的衣袍是别人织造的；

你的最可口的一餐是在别人的桌上吃的；

你的最舒适的床铺是在别人的房子里的。

那么请告诉我，你怎能把自己同别人分开呢？

你的心思和我的心怀将永远不会一致，除非你的心思不再居留于数字中，而我的心怀不再居留在云雾里。

除非我们把语言减少到七个字，我们将永不会互相了解。

我的心，除了把它敲碎以外，怎能把它打开呢？

只有深哀和极乐才能显露你的真实。

如果你愿意被显露出来，你必须在阳光中裸舞，或是背起你的十字架。

如果自然听到了我们所说的知足的话语，江河就不去寻求大海，冬天就不会变成春天。如果她听到我们所说的一切吝啬的话语，我们有多少人可以呼吸到空气呢？

当你背向太阳的时候，你只看到自己的影子。

你在白天的太阳前面是自由的，在黑夜的星辰前面也是自由的；

在没有太阳，没有月亮，没有星辰的时候，你也是自由的。

但是你是你所爱的人的奴隶，因为你爱了他。

你也是爱你的人的奴隶，因为他爱了你。

我们都是庙门前的乞丐，当国王进出庙门的时候，我们每人都分受到恩赏。

但是我们都互相妒忌，这是轻视国王的另一种方式。

你不能吃得多过你的食欲。那一半食粮是属于别人的，而且也还要为不速之客留下一点面包。

如果不为待客的话，所有的房屋都成了坟墓。

和善的狼对天真的羊说："你不光临寒舍吗？"

羊回答说："我们将以造府为荣，如果贵府不是在你肚子里的话。"

我把客人拦在门口说："不必了，在出门的时候再擦脚吧，进门的时候是不必擦的。"

慷慨不是你把我比你更需要的东西给我，而是你把你比我更需要的东西也给了我。

当你施与的时候你当然是慈善的，在授与的时候要把脸转过一边，这样就可以不看那受者的羞赧。

最富与最穷的人的差别，只在于一整天的饥饿和一个钟头的干渴。

我们常常从我们的明天预支了来偿付我们昨天的债负。

我也曾受过天使和魔鬼的造访，但是我都把他们支走了。

当天使来的时候，我念一段旧的祷文，他就厌烦了；

当魔鬼来的时候，我犯一次旧的罪过，他就从我面前走过了。

总的说来，这不是一所坏监狱；我只不喜欢在我的囚房和隔壁囚房之间的这堵墙；但是我对你保证，我决不愿责备狱吏和建造这监狱的人。

你向他们求鱼而却给你毒蛇的那些人，也许他们只有毒蛇可给。那么在他们一方面就算是慷慨的了。

欺骗有时成功，但它往往自杀。

当你饶恕那些从不流血的凶手，从不窃盗的小偷，不打诳语的说谎者的时候，你就真是一个宽大的人。

谁能把手指放在善恶分野的地方，谁就是能够摸到上帝圣袍的边缘的人。

如果你的心是一座火山的话，你怎能指望会从你的手里开出花朵来呢？

多么奇怪的一个自欺的方式！有时我宁愿受到损害和欺骗，好让我嘲笑那些以为我不知道我是被损害、欺骗了的人。

对于一个扮作被追求者的角色的追求者，我该怎么说他呢？

让那个把脏手在你衣服上擦的人，把你的衣服拿走吧。他也许还需要那件衣服，你却一定不会再要了。

兑换商不能做一个好园丁，真是可惜。

请你不要以后天的德行来粉饰你的先天的缺陷。我宁愿有缺陷，这些缺陷和我自己的一样。

有多少次我把没有犯过的罪都拉到自己身上，为的让人家在我面前感到舒服。

就是生命的面具，也都是更深的奥秘的面具。

你可能只根据自己的了解去判断别人。

现在告诉我，我们里头谁是有罪的，谁是无辜的。

真正公平的人就是对你的罪过感到应该分担的人。

只有白痴和天才，才会去破坏人造的法律，他们离上帝的心最近。

只在你被追逐的时候，你才快跑。

我没有仇人，上帝呵！如果我会有仇人的话，

就让他和我势均力敌，

只让真理做一个战胜者。

当你和敌人都死了的时候，你就会和他十分友好了。

一个人在自卫的时候可能自杀。

很久以前一个"人"，因为过于爱别人，也因太可爱了，而被钉在十字架上。

说来奇怪，昨天我碰到他三次。

第一次是他恳求一个警察不要把一个妓女关到监牢里去；第二次是他和一个无赖一块喝酒；第三次是他在教堂里和一个法官拳斗。

如果他们所谈的善恶都是正确的话，那么我的一生只是一个长时间的犯罪。

怜悯只是半个公平。

过去唯一对我不公平的人，就是那个我曾对我的兄弟不公平的人。

当你看见一个人被带进监狱的时候，在你心中默默地说："也许他是从更狭小的监狱里逃出来的。"

当你看见一个人喝醉了的时候，在你心中默默地说："也许他想躲避某些更不美好的事物。"

在自卫中我常常憎恨；但是如果我是一个比较坚强的人，我就不必使用这样的武器。

把唇上的微笑来遮掩眼里的憎恨的人，是多么愚蠢呵！

只有在我以下的人，能忌妒我或憎恨我。

我从来没有被忌妒或被憎恨过，我不在任何人之上。

只有在我以上的人，能称赞我或轻蔑我。

我从来没有被称赞或被轻蔑过；我不在任何人之下。

你对我说"我不了解你"，这就是过分地赞扬了我，无故地侮辱了你。

当生命给我金子而我给你银子的时候，我还自以为慷慨，这是多么卑鄙呵！

当你达到生命心中的时候，你会发现你不高过罪人，也不低于先知。

奇怪的是，你竟可怜那脚下慢的人，而不可怜那心里慢的人。

可怜那盲于目的人，而不可怜那盲于心的人。

瘸子不在他敌人的头上敲断他的拐杖，是更聪明些的。

那个认为从他的口袋里给你，可以从你心里取回的人，是多么糊涂呵！

生命是一支队伍。迟慢的人发现队伍走得太快了，他就走出队伍；

快步的人又发现队伍走得太慢了，他也走出队伍。

如果世上真有罪孽这件东西的话，我们中间有的人是跟着我们祖先的脚踪，倒退着造孽。

有的人是管制着我们的儿女，赶前地造孽。

真正的好人，是那个和所有大家认为坏的人在一起的人。

我们都是囚犯，不过有的是关在有窗的牢房里，有的就关在无窗的牢房里。

奇怪的是，当我们为错误辩护的时候，我们用的气力比我们捍卫正确时还大。

如果我们互相供认彼此的罪过的话，我们就会为大家并无新创而互相嘲笑。

如果我们都公开了我们的美德的话，我们也将为大家并无新创而大笑。

沙与沫（第二部分）

一个人是在人造的法律之上，直到他犯了抵触人造的惯例的罪......

一个人是在人造的法律之上，直到他犯了抵触人造的惯例的罪；

在此以后，他就不在任何人之上，也不在任何人之下。

政府是你和我之间的协定。你和我常常是错误的。

罪恶是需要的别名，或是疾病的一种。

还有比意识到别人的过失还大的过失吗？

如果别人嘲笑你，你可以怜悯他；但是如果你嘲笑他，你决不可自恕。

如果别人伤害你，你可以忘掉它；但是如果你伤害了他，你须永远记住。

实际上别人就是最敏感的你，附托在另一个躯壳上。

你要人们用你的翅翼飞翔而却连一根羽毛也拿不出的时候，你是多么轻率呵。

从前有人坐在我的桌上，吃我的饭，喝我的酒，走时还嘲笑我。

以后他再来要吃要喝，我不理他；

天使就嘲笑我。

憎恨是一件死东西，你们有谁愿意做一座坟墓？

被杀者的光荣就是他不是凶手。

人道的保护者是在它沉默的心怀中，从不在它多言的心思里。

他们认为我疯了，因为我不肯拿我的光阴去换金钱；

我认为他们是疯了，因为他们以为我的光阴是可以估价的。

他们把最昂贵的金子、银子、象牙和黑檀排列在我们的面前，我们把心胸和气魄排列在他们面前；

而他们却自称为主人，把我们当作客人。

我宁可做人类中有梦想和有完成梦想的愿望的、最渺小的人，而不愿做一个最伟大的、无梦想、无愿望的人。

最可怜的人是把他的梦想变成金银的人。

我们都在攀登自己心愿的高峰。如果另一个登山者偷了你的粮袋和钱包，而把粮袋装满了，钱包也加重了，你应当可怜他；

这攀登将为他的肉体增加困难，这负担将加长他的路程。

如果在你消瘦的情况下，看到他的肉体膨胀着往上爬，帮他一步；这样做会增加你的速度。

你不能超过你的了解去判断一个人，而你的了解是多么浅薄呵。

我决不去听一个征服者对被征服的人的说教。

真正自由的人是忍耐地背起奴隶的负担的人。

千年以前，我的邻人对我说："我恨生命，因为它只是一件痛苦的东西。"

昨天我走过一座坟园，我看见生命在他的坟上跳舞。

自然界的竞争不过是混乱渴望着秩序。

静独是吹落我们枯枝的一阵无声的风暴；

但是它把我们活生生的根芽，更深地送进活生生的大地的活生生的心里。

我曾对一条小溪谈到大海，小溪认为我只是一个幻想的夸张者；

我也曾对大海谈到小溪，大海认为我只是一个低估的诽谤者。

把蚂蚁的忙碌捧得高于蚱蜢的歌唱的眼光，是多么狭仄呵！

这个世界里的最高德行，在另一个世界也许是最低的。

深和高在直线上走到深度和高度；只有广阔能在圆周里运行。

如果不是因为我们有了重量和长度的观念，我们站在萤火光前也会同在太阳面前一样的敬畏。

一个没有想象力的科学家，好像一个拿着钝刀和旧秤的屠夫。

但既然我们不全是素食者，那么你该怎么办呢？

当你歌唱的时候，饥饿的人就用他的肚子来听。

死亡和老人的距离并不比和婴儿的距离更近；生命也是如此。

假如你必须直率地说的话，就直率得漂亮一些；要不就沉默下来，因为我们邻近有一个人快死了。

人间的葬礼也可能是天上的婚筵。

一个被忘却的真实可能死去，而在它的遗嘱里留下七千条的实情实事，作为料理丧事和建造坟墓之用。

实际上我们只对自己说话，不过有时我们说得大声一点，使得别人也能听见。

显而易见的东西是：在被人简单地表现出来之前，从不被人看到的。

假如银河不在我的意识里，我怎能看到它或了解它呢？

除非我是医生群中的一个医生，他们不会相信我是一个天文学家的。

也许大海给贝壳下的定义是珍珠。

也许时间给煤炭下的定义是钻石。

荣名是热情站在阳光中的影子。

花根是鄙弃荣名的花朵。

在美之外没有宗教，也没有科学。

我所认得的大人物的性格中都有些渺小的东西；就是这些渺小的东西，阻止了懒惰、疯狂或者自杀。

真正伟大的人是不压制人也不受人压制的人。

我决不因为那个人杀了罪人和先知，就相信他是中庸的。

容忍是和高傲狂害着相思的一种病症。

虫子是会弯曲的；但是连大象也会屈服，不是很奇怪吗？

一场争论可能是两个心思之间的捷径。

我是烈火，我也是枯枝，一部分的我消耗了另一部分的我。

我们都在寻找圣山的顶峰；假如我们把过去当作一张图表而不作为一个向导的话，我们路程不是可以缩短吗？

当智慧骄傲到不肯哭泣，庄严到不肯欢笑，自满到不肯看人的时候，就不成为智慧了。

如果我把你所知道的一切，把自己填满的话，我还能有余地来容纳你所不知道的一切吗？

我从多话的人学到了静默，从偏狭的人学到了宽容，从残忍的人学到了仁爱，但奇怪的是我对于这些老师并不感激。

执拗的人是一个极聋的演说家。

妒忌的沉默是太吵闹了。

当你达到你应该了解的终点的时候，你就处在你应该感觉的起点。

夸张是发了脾气的真理。

假如你只能看到光所显示的，只能听到声所宣告的，

那么实际上你没有看，也没有听。

一件事实是一条没有性别的真理。

你不能同时又笑又冷酷。

离我心最近的是一个没有国土的国王和一个不会求乞的穷人。

一个羞赧的失败比一个骄傲的成功还要高贵。

在任何一块土地上挖掘你都会找到珍宝，不过你应该以农民的信心去挖掘。

一个被二十个骑士和二十条猎狗追逐着的狐狸说："他们当然会打死我。但他们准是很可怜很笨拙的。假如二十只狐狸骑着二十头驴子带着二十只狼去追打一个人的话，那真是不值得的。"

是我们的心思屈服于我们自制的法律之下，我们的精神是从不屈服的。

我是一个旅行者，也是一个航海者，我每天在我的灵魂中发现一个新的王国。

一个女人抗议说："当然那是一场正义的战争。我的儿子在这场战争中牺牲了。"

我对生命说："我要听死亡说话。"

生命把她的声音提高一点说："现在你听到他说话了。"

当你解答了生命的一切奥秘，你就渴望死亡，因为它不过是生命的另一个奥秘。

生与死是勇敢的两种最高贵的表现。

我的朋友，你和我对于生命将永远是个陌生者，我们彼此也是陌生者，对自己也是陌生者，

直到你要说、我要听的那一天，

把你的声音作为我的声音；

当我站在你的面前

觉得我是站在镜前的时候。

他们对我说："你能自知你就能了解所有的人。"

我说："只有我寻求所有的人我才能自知。"

一个人有两个我，一个在黑暗里醒着，一个在光明中睡着。

隐士是遗弃了一部分的世界，使他可以无惊无扰地享受着整个世界。

在学者和诗人之间伸展着一片绿野？如果学者穿走过去，他就成个圣贤；如果诗人穿走过来，他就成个先知。

昨天我看见哲学家们把他们的头颅装在篮子里，在市场上高声叫卖："智慧，卖智慧咯！"

可怜的哲学家！他们必须出卖他们的头来喂养他们的心。

一个哲学家对一个清道夫说："我可怜你，你的工作又苦又脏。"

清道夫说："谢谢你，先生。请告诉我，你做什么工作？"

哲学家回答说："我研究人的心思、行为和愿望。"

清道夫一面扫街一面微笑说："我也可怜你。"

听真理的人并不弱于讲真理的人。

没有人能在需要与奢侈之间画一条界线。只有天使能这样做，天使是明智而热切的。

也许天使就是我们在太空中的更高尚的思想。

在托钵僧的心中找到自己的宝座的是真正的王子。

慷慨是超过自己能力的施与，自尊是少于自己需要的接受。

实际上你不欠任何人的债。你欠所有的人一切的债。

从前生活过的人现在都和我们一起活着。我们中间当然没有人愿意做一个慢客的主人。

想望得最多的人活得最长。

他们对我说："十鸟在树不如一鸟在手。"

我却说："一鸟一羽在树胜过十鸟在手。"

你对那根羽毛的追求，就是脚下生翼的生命；不，它就是生命的本身。

世界上只有两个原素，美和真；美在情人的心中，真在耕者的臂里。

伟大的美俘虏了我，但是一个更伟大的美居然把我从掌握中释放了。

美在想望它的人的心里比在看到它的人的眼里，放出更明亮的光彩。

我爱慕那对我倾诉心怀的人，我尊重那对我披露梦想的人。但是为什么在服侍我的人面前，我却腼腆，甚至于带些羞愧呢？

天才曾以能侍奉王子为荣。

现在他们以侍奉贫民为荣。

天使们晓得，有过多的讲实际的人，就着梦想者眉间的汗，吃他们的面包。

风趣往往是一副面具。你如能把它扯了下来，你将发现一个被激恼了的才智，或是在变着戏法的聪明。

聪明把聪明归功于我，愚钝把愚钝归罪于我。我想他俩都是对的。

只有自己心里有秘密的人才能参透我们心里的秘密。

只能和你同乐不能和你共苦的人，丢掉了天堂七个门中的一把钥匙。

是的，世界上是有涅磐；它是在把羊群带到碧绿的牧场的时候，在哄着你孩子睡觉的时候，在哄着你孩子睡觉的时候，在写着你的最后一行诗句的时候。　

远在体验到它们以前，我们就已经选择了我们的欢乐和悲哀了。

忧愁是两座花园之间的一堵墙壁。

当你的欢乐和悲哀变大的时候，世界就变小了。

愿望是半个生命，淡漠是半个死亡。

我们今天的悲哀里最苦的东西，是我们昨天的欢乐的回忆。

他们对我说："你必须在今生的欢娱和来世的平安之中作个选择。"

我对他们说："我已选择了今生的愉快和来世的安宁。因为我心里知道那最大的诗人只写过一首诗，而这首诗是完全合乎音节韵律的。"

信仰是心中的绿洲，思想的骆驼队是永远走不到的。

当你求达你的高度的时候，你将想望，但要只为想望而想望；你应为饥饿而热望；你应为更大的干渴而渴望。

假如你对风泄露了你的秘密，你就不应当去责备风对树林泄露了秘密。

春天的花朵是天使们在早餐桌上所谈论的冬天的梦想。

鼬鼠对月下香说："看我跑得多快，你却不能走，也不会爬。"

月下香对鼬鼠说："\*銧，最高贵的快腿，请你快快跑开吧！"

乌龟比兔子更能多讲些道路的情况。

奇怪的是没有脊骨的生物都有最坚硬的壳。

话最多的人是最不聪明的人，在一个演说家和一个拍卖人之间，几乎没有分别。

你应该感谢，因为你不必靠着父亲的名望或伯叔的财产来生活。

但是最应感谢的是，没有人必须靠着你的名誉或财产来生活。

只在一个变戏法的人接不到球的时候，他才能吸引我。

忌妒我的人在不知不觉之中颂扬了我。

在很久的时间，你是你母亲睡眠里的一个梦，以后她醒起把你生了下来。

人类的胚芽是在你母亲的愿望里。

我的父母愿意有个孩子，他们就生下我。

我要母亲和父亲，我就生下了黑夜和海洋。

有的儿女使我们感到此生不虚，有的儿女为我们留下终身之憾。

当黑夜来了而你也阴郁的时候，就坚决地阴郁着躺了下去。

当早晨来了而你还感着阴郁的时候，就站起来坚决地对白天说："我还是阴郁的。"

对黑夜和白天扮演角色是愚蠢的。

他俩都会嘲笑你。

雾里的山岳不是丘陵；雨中的橡树也不是垂柳。

看哪，这一个似非而是的论断：深和高是比"折中"和"两可"更为相近。

当我一面明镜似地站在你面前的时候，你注视着我看到了自己的形象。

然后你说："我爱你。"

但是实际上你爱的是我里面的你。

当你以爱邻为乐的时候，它就不是美德了。

不时常涌溢的爱就往往死掉。

你不能同时又有青春又有关于青春的知识。

因为青春忙于生活，而顾不得去了解；而知识为着要生活，而忙于自我寻求。

你有时坐在窗边看望过往行人。望着望着地，你也许看见一个尼姑向你右手边走来，一个妓女向你左手边走来。

你也许在无意中说出"这一个是多么高洁而那一个又是多么卑贱。"

假如你闭起眼睛静听一会，你会听到太空中有个声音低语说："这一个在祈祷中寻求我，那一个在痛苦中寻求我。在各人的心灵里，都有一座供奉我的心灵的庵堂。"

每隔一百年，拿撒勒的耶稣就和基督徒的耶稣在黎巴嫩山中的花园里相会。他们作了长谈；每次当拿撒勒的耶稣向基督徒的耶稣道别的时候，他都说："我的朋友，我恐怕我们两人永远、永远也不会一致。"

求上帝喂养那些穷奢极欲的人吧！

一个伟大的人有两颗心：一颗心流血，另一颗心宽容。

如果一个人说了并不伤害你或任何人的谎话，为什么不在你心里说，他堆放事实的房子是太小了，搁不下他的胡想，他必须把胡想留待更大的地场。

在每扇关起的门后，都有一个用七道封皮封起的秘密。

等待是时间的蹄子。

假如困难是你东墙上的一扇新开的窗户，那你怎么办呢？

和你一同笑过的人，你可能把他忘掉；但是和你一同哭过的人，你却永远不忘。

在盐里面一定有些出奇地神圣的东西。它也在我们的眼泪里和大海里。

我们的上帝在他慈悲的干渴里，会把我们——露珠和眼泪——都喝下去。

你不过是你的大我的一个碎片，一张寻求面包的嘴，一只盲目的、为一张干渴的嘴举着水杯的手。

只要你从种族、国家和自身之上，升起一腕尺，你就真成了神一样的人。

假如我是你，我决不在低潮的时候去抱怨大海。

船是一只好船，我们的船主是精干的；只不过是你的肚子不合适就是了。

我们想望而得不到的东西，比我们已经得到的东西总要宝贵些。

假如你能坐在云头上，你就看不见两国之间的界线，也看不见庄园之间的界石。

可惜的是你不能坐在云头上。

七百年以前有七只白鸽，从幽谷里飞上高山的雪峰。七个看到鸽子飞翔的人中，有一个说："我看出第七只鸽子的翅膀上，有一个黑点。"

今天这山谷里的人们，就说飞上雪山顶峰的是七只黑鸽。

在秋天，我收集起我的一切烦恼，把它们埋在我的花园里。

四月又到，春天来同大地结婚，在我的花园里开出与众花不同的美丽的花。

我的邻人们都来赏花，他们对我说："当秋天再来，该下种子的时候，你好不好把这些花种分给我们，让我们的花园里也有这些花呢？

假如我向人伸出空手而得不到东西，那当然是苦恼；但是假如我伸出一只满握的手，而发现没有人来接受，那才是绝望呢。

我渴望着来生，因为在那里我将会看到我的未写出的诗和未画出的画。

### SAND AND FOAM\(first part\)

i am forever walking upon these shores,

betwixt the sand and the foam,

the high tide will erase my foot-prints,

and the wind will blow away the foam.

but the sea and the shore will remain

forever.

once i filled my hand with mist.

then i opened it and lo, the mist was a worm.

and i closed and opened my hand again, and behold there was a bird.

and again i closed and opened my hand, and in its hollow stood a man with a sad face, turned upward.

and again i closed my hand, and when i opened it there was naught but mist.

but i heard a song of exceeding sweetness.

it was but yesterday i thought myself a fragment quivering without rhythm in the sphere of life.

now i know that i am the sphere, and all life in rhythmic fragments moves within me.

they say to me in their awakening, "you and the world you live in are but a grain of sand upon the infinite shore of an infinite sea."

and in my dream i say to them, "i am the infinite sea, and all worlds are but grains of sand upon my shore."

only once have i been made mute. it was when a man asked me, "who are you?"

the first thought of god was an angel.

the first word of god was a man.

we were fluttering, wandering, longing creatures a thousand thousand years before the sea and the wind in the forest gave us words.

now how can we express the ancient of days in us with only the sounds of our yesterdays?

the sphinx spoke only once, and the sphinx said, "a grain of sand is a desert, and a desert is a grain of sand; and now let us all be silent again."

i heard the sphinx, but i did not understand.

long did i lie in the dust of egypt, silent and unaware of the seasons.

then the sun gave me birth, and i rose and walked upon the banks of the nile,

singing with the days and dreaming with the nights.

and now the sun threads upon me with a thousand feet that i may lie again in the dust of egypt.

but behold a marvel and a riddle!

the very sun that gathered me cannot scatter me.

still erect am i, and sure of foot do i walk upon the banks of the nile.

remembrance is a form of meeting.

forgetfulness is a form of freedom.

we measure time according to the movement of countless suns; and they measure time by little machines in their little pockets.

now tell me, how could we ever meet at the same place and the same time?

space is not space between the earth and the sun to one who looks down from the windows of the milky way.

humanity is a river of light running from the ex-eternity to eternity.

do not the spirits who dwell in the ether envy man his pain?

on my way to the holy city i met another pilgrim and i asked him, "is this indeed the way to the holy city?"

and he said, "follow me, and you will reach the holy city in a day and a night."

and i followed him. and we walked many days and many nights, yet we did not reach the holy city.

and what was to my surprise he became angry with me because he had misled me.

make me, oh god, the prey of the lion, ere you make the rabbit my prey.

one may not reach the dawn save by the path of the night.

my house says to me, "do not leave me, for here dwells your past."

and the road says to me, "come and follow me, for i am your future."

and i say to both my house and the road, "i have no past, nor have i a future. if i stay here, there is a going in my staying; and if i go there is a staying in my going. only love and death will change all things."

how can i lose faith in the justice of life, when the dreams of those who sleep upon feathers are not more beautiful than the dreams of those who sleep upon the earth? strange, the desire for certain pleasures is a part of my pain.

seven times have i despised my soul:

the first time when i saw her being meek that she might attain height.

the second time when i saw her limping before the crippled.

the third time when she was given to choose between the hard and the easy, and she chose the easy.

the fourth time when she committed a wrong, and comforted herself that others also commit wrong.

the fifth time when she forbore for weakness, and attributed her patience to strength.

the sixth time when she despised the ugliness of a face, and knew not that it was one of her own masks.

and the seventh time when she sang a song of praise, and deemed it a virtue.

i am ignorant of absolute truth. but i am humble before my ignorance and therein lies my honour and my reward.

there is a space between mans imagination and mans attainment that may only be traversed by his longing.

paradise is there, behind that door, in the next room; but i have lost the key.

perhaps i have only mislaid it.

you are blind and i am deaf and dumb, so let us touch hands and understand.

the significance of man is not in what he attains, but rather in what he longs to attain.

some of us are like ink and some like paper.

and if it were not for the blackness of some of us, some of us would be dumb;

and if it were not for the whiteness of some of us, some of us would be blind.

give me an ear and i will give you a voice.

our mind is a sponge; our heart is a stream.

is it not strange that most of us choose sucking rather than running?

when you long for blessings that you may not name, and when you grieve knowing not the cause, then indeed you are growing with all things that grow, and rising toward your greater self.

when one is drunk with a vision, he deems his faint expression of it the very wine.

you drink wine that you may be intoxicated; and i drink that it may sober me from that other wine.

when my cup is empty i resign myself to its emptiness; but when it is half full i resent its half-fullness.

the reality of the other person is not in what he reveals to you, but in what he cannot reveal to you.

therefore, if you would understand him, listen not to what he says but rather to what he does not say.

half of what i say is meaningless; but i say it so that the other half may reach you.

a sense of humour is a sense of proportion.

my loneliness was born when men praised my talkative faults and blamed my silent virtues.

when life does not find a singer to sing her heart she produces a philosopher to speak her mind.

a truth is to be known always, to be uttered sometimes.

the real in us is silent; the acquired is talkative.

the voice of life in me cannot reach the ear of life in you; but let us talk that we may not feel lonely.

when two women talk they say nothing; when one woman speaks she reveals all of life.

frogs may bellow louder than bulls, but they cannot drag the plough in the field not turn the wheel of the winepress, and of their skins you cannot make shoes.

only the dumb envy the talkative.

if winter should say, "spring is in my heart," who would believe winter?

every seed is a longing.

should you really open your eyes and see, you would behold your image in all images.

and should you open your ears and listen, you would hear your own voice in all voices.

it takes two of us to discover truth: one to utter it and one to understand it.

though the wave of words is forever upon us, yet our depth is forever silent.

many a doctrine is like a window pane. we see truth through it but it divides us from truth.

now let us play hide and seek. should you hide in my heart it would not be difficult to find you. but should you hide behind your own shell, then it would be useless for anyone to seek you. a woman may veil her face with a smile.

how noble is the sad heart who would sing a joyous song with joyous hearts.

he who would understand a woman, or dissect genius, or solve the mystery of silence is the very man who would wake from a beautiful dream to sit at a breakfast table.

i would walk with all those who walk. i would not stand still to watch the procession passing by.

you owe more than gold to him who serves you. give him of your heart or serve him.

nay, we have not lived in vain. have they not built towers of our bones?

let us not be particular and sectional. the poets mind and the scorpions tail rise in glory from the same earth.

every dragon gives birth to a st. george who slays it.

trees are poems that the earth writes upon the sky. we fell them down and turn them into paper that we may record our emptiness.

should you care to write \(and only the saints know why you should\) you must needs have knowledge and art and music -- the knowledge of the music of words, the art of being artless, and the magic of loving your readers.

they dip their pens in our hearts and think they are inspired.

should a tree write its autobiography it would not be unlike the history of a race.

if i were to choose between the power of writing a poem and the ecstasy of a poem unwritten, i would choose the ecstasy. it is better poetry.

but you and all my neighbours agree that i always choose badly.

poetry is not an opinion expressed. it is a song that rises from a bleeding wound or a smiling mouth.

words are timeless. you should utter them or write them with a knowledge of their timelessness.

a poet is a dethroned king sitting among the ashes of his palace trying to fashion an image out of the ashes.

poetry is a deal of joy and pain and wonder, with a dash of the dictionary.

in vain shall a poet seek the mother of the songs of his heart.

once i said to a poet, "we shall not know your worth until you die."

and he answered saying, "yes, death is always the revealer. and if indeed you would know my worth it is that i have more in my heart than upon my tongue, and more in my desire than in my hand."

if you sing of beauty though alone in the heart of the desert you will have an audience.

poetry is wisdom that enchants the heart.

wisdom is poetry that sings in the mind.

if we could enchant mans heart and at the same time sing in his mind,

then in truth he would live in the shadow of god.

inspiration will always sing; inspiration will never explain.

we often sing lullabies to our children that we ourselves may sleep.

all our words are but crumbs that fall down from the feast of the mind.

thinking is always the stumbling stone to poetry.

a great singer is he who sings our silences.

how can you sing if your mouth be filled with food?

how shall your hand be raised in blessing if it is filled with gold?

they say the nightingale pierces his bosom with a thorn when he sings his love song.

so do we all. how else should we sing?

genius is but a robins song at the beginning of a slow spring.

even the most winged spirit cannot escape physical necessity.

a madman is not less a musician than you or myself; only the instrument on which he plays is a little out of tune.

the song that lies silent in the heart of a mother sings upon the lips of her child.

no longing remains unfulfilled.

i have never agreed with my other self wholly. the truth of the matter seems to lie between us.

your other self is always sorry for you. but your other self grows on sorrow; so all is well.

there is no struggle of soul and body save in the minds of those whose souls are asleep and whose bodies are out of tune.

when you reach the heart of life you shall find beauty in all things, even in the eyes that are blind to beauty.

we live only to discover beauty. all else is a form of waiting.

sow a seed and the earth will yield you a flower. dream your dream to the sky and it will bring you your beloved.

the devil died the very day you were born.

now you do not have to go through hell to meet an angel.

many a woman borrows a mans heart; very few could possess it.

if you would possess you must not claim.

when a mans hand touches the hand of a woman they both touch the heart of eternity.

love is the veil between lover and lover.

every man loves two women; the one is the creation of his imagination, and the other is not yet born.

men who do not forgive women their little faults will never enjoy their great virtues.

love that does not renew itself every day becomes a habit and in turn a slavery.

lovers embrace that which is between them rather than each other.

love and doubt have never been on speaking terms.

love is a word of light, written by a hand of light, upon a page of light.

friendship is always a sweet responsibility, never an opportunity.

if you do not understand your friend under all conditions you will never understand him.

your most radiant garment is of the other persons weaving;

you most savoury meal is that which you eat at the other persons table;

your most comfortable bed is in the other persons house.

now tell me, how can you separate yourself from the other person?

your mind and my heart will never agree until your mind ceases to live in numbers and my heart in the mist.

we shall never understand one another until we reduce the language to seven words.

how shall my heart be unsealed unless it be broken?

only great sorrow or great joy can reveal your truth.

if you would be revealed you must either dance naked in the sun, or carry your cross.

should nature heed what we say of contentment no river would seek the sea, and no winter would turn to spring. should she heed all we say of thrift, how many of us would be breathing this air?

you see but your shadow when you turn your back to the sun.

you are free before the sun of the day, and free before the stars of the night;

and you are free when there is no sun and no moon and no star.

you are even free when you close your eyes upon all there is.

but you are a slave to him whom you love because you love him,

and a slave to him who loves you because he loves you.

we are all beggars at the gate of the temple, and each one of us receives his share of the bounty of the king when he enters the temple, and when he goes out.

but we are all jealous of one another, which is another way of belittling the king.

you cannot consume beyond your appetite. the other half of the loaf belongs to the other person, and there should remain a little bread for the chance guest.

if it were not for your guests all houses would be graves.

said a gracious wolf to a simple sheep, "will you not honour our house with a visit?"

and the sheep answered, "we would have been honoured to visit your house if it were not in your stomach."

i stopped my guest on the threshold and said, "nay, wipe not your feet as you enter, but as you go out."

generosity is not in giving me that which i need more than you do, but it is in giving me that which you need more than i do.

you are indeed charitable when you give, and while giving, turn your face away so that you may not see the shyness of the receiver.

the difference between the richest man and the poorest is but a day of hunger and an hour of thirst.

we often borrow from our tomorrows to pay our debts to our yesterdays.

i too am visited by angels and devils, but i get rid of them.

when it is an angel i pray an old prayer, and he is bored;

when it is a devil i commit an old sin, and he passes me by.

after all this is not a bad prison; but i do not like this wall between my cell and the next prisoners cell;

yet i assure you that i do not wish to reproach the warder not the builder of the prison.

those who give you a serpent when you ask for a fish, may have nothing but serpents to give. it is then generosity on their part.

trickery succeeds sometimes, but it always commits suicide.

you are truly a forgiver when you forgive murderers who never spill blood, thieves who never steal, and liars who utter no falsehood.

he who can put his finger upon that which divides good from evil is he who can touch the very hem of the garment of god.

if your heart is a volcano how shall you expect flowers to bloom in your hands?

### SAND AND FOAM\(second part\)

a strange form of self-indulgence! there are times when i would be wronged and cheated, that i may laugh at the expense of those who think i do not know i am being wronged and cheated.

what shall i say of him who is the pursuer playing the part of the pursued?

let him who wipes his soiled hands with your garment take your garment. he may need it again; surely you would not.

it is a pity that money-changers cannot be good gardeners.

please do not whitewash your inherent faults with your acquired virtues. i would have the faults; they are like mine own.

how often have i attributed to myself crimes i have never committed, so that the other person may feel comfortable in my presence.

even the masks of life are masks of deeper mystery.

you may judge others only according to your knowledge of yourself.

tell me now, who among us is guilty and who is unguilty?

the truly just is he who feels half guilty of your misdeeds.

only an idiot and a genius break man-made laws; and they are the nearest to the heart of god.

it is only when you are pursued that you become swift.

i have no enemies, o god, but if i am to have an enemy

let his strength be equal to mine,

that truth alone may be the victor.

you will be quite friendly with your enemy when you both die.

perhaps a man may commit suicide in self-defence.

long ago there lived a man who was crucified for being too loving and too lovable.

and strange to relate i met him thrice yesterday.

the first time he was asking a policeman not to take a prostitute to prison; the second time he was drinking wine with an outcast; and the third time he was having a fist-fight with a promoter inside a church.

if all they say of good and evil were true, then my life is but one long crime.

pity is but half justice.

the only one who has been unjust to me is the one to whose brother i have been unjust.

when you see a man led to prison say in your heart, "mayhap he is escaping from a narrower prison."

and when you see a man drunken say in your heart, "mayhap he sought escape from something still more unbeautiful."

oftentimes i have hated in self-defence; but if i were stronger i would not have used such a weapon.

how stupid is he who would patch the hatred in his eyes with the smile of his lips.

only those beneath me can envy or hate me.

i have never been envied nor hated; i am above no one.

only those above me can praise or belittle me.

i have never been praised nor belittled; i am below no one.

your saying to me, "i do not understand you," is praise beyond my worth, and an insult you do not deserve. how mean am i when life gives me gold and i give you silver, and yet i deem myself generous.

when you reach the heart of life you will find yourself not higher than the felon, and not lower than the prophet.

strange that you should pity the slow-footed and not the slow-minded,

and the blind-eyed rather than the blind-hearted.

it is wiser for the lame not to break his crutches upon the head of his enemy.

how blind is he who gives you out of his pocket that he may take out of your heart.

life is a procession. the slow of foot finds it too swift and he steps out;

and the swift of foot finds it too slow and he too steps out.

if there is such a thing as sin some of us commit it backward following our forefathers footsteps;

and some of us commit it forward by overruling our children.

the truly good is he who is one with all those who are deemed bad.

we are all prisoners but some of us are in cells with windows and some without.

strange that we all defend our wrongs with more vigour than we do our rights.

should we all confess our sins to one another we would all laugh at one another for our lack of originality.

should we all reveal our virtues we would also laugh for the same cause.

an individual is above man-made laws until he commits a crime against man-made conventions; after that he is neither above anyone nor lower than anyone.

government is an agreement between you and myself. you and myself are often wrong.

crime is either another name of need or an aspect of a disease.

is there a greater fault than being conscious of the other persons faults?

if the other person laughs at you, you can pity him; but if you laugh at him you may never forgive yourself.

if the other person injures you, you may forget the injury; but if you injure him you will always remember.

in truth the other person is your most sensitive self given another body.

how heedless you are when you would have men fly with your wings and you cannot even give them a feather.

once a man sat at my board and ate my bread and drank my wine and went away laughing at me.

then he came again for bread and wine, and i spurned him;

and the angels laughed at me.

hate is a dead thing. who of you would be a tomb?

it is the honour of the murdered that he is not the murderer.

the tribune of humanity is in its silent heart, never its talkative mind.

they deem me mad because i will not sell my days for gold;

and i deem them mad because they think my days have a price.

they spread before us their riches of gold and silver, of ivory and ebony, and we spread before them our hearts and our spirits.;

and yet they deem themselves the hosts and us the guests.

i would not be the least among men with dreams and the desire to fulfil them, rather than the greatest with no dreams and no desires.

the most pitiful among men is he who turns his dreams into silver and gold.

we are all climbing toward the summit of our hearts desire. should the other climber steal your sack and your purse and wax fat on the one and heavy on the other, you should pity him;

the climbing will be harder for his flesh, and the burden will make his way longer.

and should you in your leanness see his flesh puffing upward, help him a step; it will add to your swiftness.

you cannot judge any man beyond your knowledge of him, and how small is your knowledge.

i would not listen to a conqueror preaching to the conquered.

the truly free man is he who bears the load of the bond slave patiently.

a thousand years ago my neighbour said to me, "i hate life, for it is naught but a thing of pain."

and yesterday i passed by a cemetery and saw life dancing upon his grave.

strife in nature is but disorder longing for order.

solitude is a silent storm that breaks down all our dead branches;

yet it sends our living roots deeper into the living heart of the living earth.

once i spoke of the sea to a brook, and the brook thought me but an imaginative exaggerator;

and once i spoke of a brook to the sea, and the sea thought me but a depreciative defamer.

how narrow is the vision that exalts the busyness of the ant above the singing of the grasshopper.

the highest virtue here may be the least in another world.

the deep and the high go to the depth or to the height in a straight line; only the spacious can move in circles.

if it were not not for our conception of weights and measures we would stand in awe of the firefly as we do before the sun.

a scientist without imagination is a butcher with dull knives and out-worn scales.

but what would you, since we are not all vegetarians?

when you sing the hungry hears you with his stomach.

death is not nearer to the aged than to the new-born; neither is life.

if indeed you must be candid, be candid beautifully; otherwise keep silent, for there is a man in our neighbourhood who is dying.

mayhap a funeral among men is a wedding feast among the angels.

a forgotten reality may die and leave in its will seven thousand actualities and facts to be spent in its funeral and the building of a tomb.

in truth we talk only to ourselves, but sometimes we talk loud enough that others may hear us.

the obvious is that which is never seen until someone expresses it simply.

if the milky way were not within me how should i have seen it or known it?

unless i am a physician among physicians they would not believe that i am an astronomer.

perhaps the seas definition of a shell is the pearl.

perhaps times definition of coal is the diamond.

fame is the shadow of passion standing in the light.

a root is a flower that disdains fame.

there is neither religion nor science beyond beauty.

every great man i have known had something small in his make-up; and it was that small something which prevented inactivity or madness or suicide.

the truly great man is he who would master no one, and who would be mastered by none.

i would not believe that a man is mediocre simply because he kills the criminals and the prophets.

tolerance is love sick with the sickness of haughtiness.

worms will turn; but is it not strange that even elephants will yield?

a disagreement may be the shortest cut between two minds.

i am the flame and i am the dry bush, and one part of me consumes the other part.

we are all seeking the summit of the holy mountain; but shall not our road be shorter if we consider the past a chart and not a guide?

wisdom ceases to be wisdom when it becomes too proud to weep, too grave to laugh, and too self-full to seek other than itself.

had i filled myself with all that you know what room should i have for all that you do not know?

i have learned silence from the talkative, toleration from the intolerant, and kindness from the unkind; yet strange, i am ungrateful to these teachers.

a bigot is a stone-leaf orator.

the silence of the envious is too noisy.

when you reach the end of what you should know, you will be at the beginning of what you should sense.

an exaggeration is a truth that has lost its temper.

if you can see only what light reveals and hear only what sound announces,

then in truth you do not see nor do you hear.

a fact is a truth unsexed.

you cannot laugh and be unkind at the same time.

the nearest to my heart are a king without a kingdom and a poor man who does not know how to beg.

a shy failure is nobler than an immodest success.

dig anywhere in the earth and you will find a treasure, only you must dig with the faith of a peasant.

said a hunted fox followed by twenty horsemen and a pack of twenty hounds, "of course they will kill me. but how poor and how stupid they must be. surely it would not be worth while for twenty foxes riding on twenty asses and accompanied by twenty wolves to chase and kill one man."

it is the mind in us that yields to the laws made by us, but never the spirit in us.

a traveller am i and a navigator, and every day i discover a new region within my soul.

a woman protested saying, "of course it was a righteous war. my son fell in it."

i said to life, "i would hear death speak."

and life raised her voice a little higher and said, "you hear him now."

when you have solved all the mysteries of life you long for death, for it is but another mystery of life.

birth and death are the two noblest expressions of bravery.

my friend, you and i shall remain strangers unto life,

and unto one another, and each unto himself,

until the day when you shall speak and i shall listen

deeming your voice my own voice;

and when i shall stand before you

thinking myself standing before a mirror.

they say to me, "should you know yourself you would know all men."

and i say, "only when i seek all men shall i know myself."

man is two men; one is awake in darkness, the other is asleep in light.

a hermit is one who renounces the world of fragments that he may enjoy the world wholly and without interruption.

there lies a green field between the scholar and the poet; should the scholar cross it he becomes a wise man; should the poet cross it, he becomes a prophet.

yestereve i saw philosophers in the market-place carrying their heads in baskets, and crying aloud, "wisdom! wisdom for sale!"

poor philosophers! they must needs sell their heads to feed their hearts. said a philosopher to a street sweeper, "i pity you. yours is a hard and dirty task."

and the street sweeper said, "thank you, sir. but tell me what is your task?"

and the philosopher answered saying, "i study mans mind, his deeds and his desires."

then the street sweeper went on with his sweeping and said with a smile, "i pity you too."

he who listens to truth is not less than he who utters truth.

no man can draw the line between necessities and luxuries. only the angels can do that, and the angels are wise and wistful.

perhaps the angels are our better thought in space.

he is the true prince who finds his throne in the heart of the dervish.

generosity is giving more than you can, and pride is taking less than you need.

in truth you owe naught to any man. you owe all to all men.

all those who have lived in the past live with us now. surely none of us would be an ungracious host.

he who longs the most lives the longest.

they say to me, "a bird in the hand is worth ten in the bush."

but i say, "a bird and a feather in the bush is worth more than ten birds in the hand."

your seeking after that feather is life with winged feet; nay, it is life itself.

there are only two elements here, beauty and truth; beauty in the hearts of lovers, and truth in the arms of the tillers of the soil.

great beauty captures me, but a beauty still greater frees me even from itself.

beauty shines brighter in the heart of him who longs for it than in the eyes of him who sees it.

i admire him who reveals his mind to me; i honour him who unveils his dreams. but why am i shy, and even a little ashamed before him who serves me?

the gifted were once proud in serving princes.

now they claim honour in serving paupers.

the angels know that too many practical men eat their bread with the sweat of the dreamers brow.

wit is often a mask. if you could tear it you would find either a genius irritated or cleverness juggling.

the understanding attributes to me understanding and the dull, dullness. i think they are both right.

only those with secrets in their hearts could divine the secrets in our hearts.

he who would share your pleasure but not your pain shall lose the key to one of the seven gates of paradise.

### SAND AND FOAM\(third part\)

yes, there is a nirvana; it is in leading your sheep to a green pasture, and in putting your child to sleep, and in writing the last line of your poem.

we choose our joys and our sorrows long before we experience them.

sadness is but a wall between two gardens.

when either your joy or your sorrow becomes great the world becomes small.

desire is half of life; indifference is half of death.

the bitterest thing in our todays sorrow is the memory of our yesterdays joy.

they say to me, "you must needs choose between the pleasures of this world and the peace of the next world."

and i say to them, "i have chosen both the delights of this world and the peace of the next. for i know in my heart that the supreme poet wrote but one poem, and it scans perfectly, and it also rhymes perfectly."

faith is an oasis in the heart which will never be reached by the caravan of thinking.

when you reach your height you shall desire but only for desire; and you shall hunger, for hunger; and you shall thirst for greater thirst.

if you reveal your secrets to the wind you should not blame the wind for revealing them to the trees.

the flowers of spring are winters dreams related at the breakfast table of the angels.

said a skunk to a tube-rose, "see how swiftly i run, while you cannot walk nor even creep."

said the tube-rose to the skunk, "oh, most noble swift runner, please run swiftly!"

turtles can tell more about roads than hares.

strange that creatures without backbones have the hardest shells.

the most talkative is the least intelligent, and there is hardly a difference between an orator and an auctioneer.

be grateful that you do not have to live down the renown of a father nor the wealth of an uncle.

but above all be grateful that no one will have to live down either your renown or your wealth.

only when a juggler misses catching his ball does he appeal to me.

the envious praises me unknowingly.

long were you a dream in your mothers sleep, and then she woke to give you birth.

the germ of the race is in your mothers longing.

my father and mother desired a child and they begot me.

and i wanted a mother and a father and i begot night and the sea.

some of our children are our justifications and some are but our regrets.

when night comes and you too are dark, lie down and be dark with a will.

and when morning comes and you are still dark stand up and say to the day with a will, "i am still dark."

it is stupid to play a role with the night and the day.

they would both laugh at you.

the mountain veiled in mist is not a hill; an oak tree in the rain is not a weeping willow.

behold here is a paradox; the deep and high are nearer to one another than the mid-level to either.

when i stood a clear mirror before you, you gazed into me and saw your image.

then you said, "i love you."

but in truth you loved yourself in me.

when you enjoy loving your neighbour it ceases to be a virtue.

love which is not always springing is always dying.

you cannot have youth and the knowledge of it at the same time;

for youth is too busy living to know, and knowledge is too busy seeking itself to live. you may sit at your window watching the passers-by. and watching you may see a nun walking toward your right hand, and a prostitute toward your left hand.

and you may say in your innocence, "how noble is the one and how ignoble is the other."

but should you close your eyes and listen awhile you would hear a voice whispering in the ether, "one seeks me in prayer, and the other in pain. and in the spirit of each there is a bower for my spirit."

once every hundred years jesus of nazareth meets jesus of the christian in a garden among the hills of lebanon. and they talk long; and each time jesus of nazareth goes away saying to jesus of the christian, "my friend, i fear we shall never, never agree."

may god feed the over-abundant!

a great man has two hearts; one bleeds and the other forbears.

should one tell a lie which does not hurt you nor anyone else, why not say in your heart that the house of his facts is too small for his fancies, and he had to leave it for larger space?

behind every closed door is a mystery sealed with seven seals.

waiting is the hoofs of time.

what if trouble should be a new window in the eastern wall of your house?

you may forget the one with whom you have laughed, but never the one with whom you have wept.

there must be something strangely sacred in salt. it is in our tears and in the sea.

our god in his gracious thirst will drink us all, the dewdrop and the tear.

you are but a fragment of your giant self, a mouth that seeks bread, and a blind hand that holds the cup for a thirsty mouth.

if you would rise but a cubit above race and country and self you would indeed become godlike.

if i were you i would not find fault with the sea at low tide.

it is a good ship and our captain is able; it is only your stomach that is in disorder.

should you sit upon a cloud you would not see the boundary line between one country and another, nor the boundary stone between a farm and a farm.

it is a pity you cannot sit upon a cloud.

seven centuries ago seven white doves rose from a deep valley flying to the snow-white summit of the mountain. one of the seven men who watched the flight said, "i see a black spot on the wing of the seventh dove."

today the people in that valley tell of seven black doves who flew to the summit of the snowy mountain.

in the autumn i gathered all my sorrows and buried them in my garden.

and when april returned and spring came to wed the earth, there grew in my garden beautiful flowers unlike all other flowers.

and my neighbours came to behold them, and they all said to me, "when autumn comes again, at seeding time, will you not give us of the seeds of these flowers that we may have them in our gardens?"

it is indeed misery if i stretch an empty hand to men and receive nothing; but it is hopelessness if i stretch a full hand and find none to receive.

i long for eternity because there i shall meet my unwritten poems and my unpainted pictures.

art is a step from nature toward the infinite.

a work of art is a mist carved into an image.

even the hands that make crowns of thorns are better than idle hands.

our most sacred tears never seek our eyes.

every man is the descendant of every king and every slave that ever lived.

if the great-grandfather of jesus had known what was hidden within him, would he not have stood in awe of himself?

was the love of judas mother of her son less than the love of mary for jesus?

there are three miracles of our brother jesus not yet recorded in the book: the first that he was a man like you and me, the second that he had a sense of humour, and the third that he knew he was a conqueror though conquered.

crucified one, you are crucified upon my heart; and the nails that pierce your hands pierce the walls of my heart.

and tomorrow when a stranger passes by this golgotha he will not know that two bled here.

he will deem it the blood of one man.

you may have heard of the blessed mountain.

it is the highest mountain in our world.

should you reach the summit you would have only one desire, and that to descend and be with those who dwell in the deepest valley.

that is why it is called the blessed mountain.

every thought i have imprisoned in expression i must free by my deeds.
