Critical thinkers are able to analyze issues from a wide variety of angles, resulting in more success in business and life. Discover your ability to think critically today with these ten signs you’re a critical thinker.

## 1. You get your news from a wide variety of sources.

Critical thinkers know that partisan politics come into play at any mainstream media outlet, so they strive to learn about the world from a variety of sources that offer different journalistic voices. They check out places like [the Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/) for a conservative perspective, [Salon](http://www.salon.com/) for a liberal slant, [First Look Media](https://www.firstlook.org/) for a more aggressive approach to investigative journalism, and they might even follow the politics thread on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics) for a `smorgasbord` that offers every taste imaginable.

> 拥有批判性思维者的人知道，任何主流媒体都会出现党派政治，因此他们努力从不同渠道来源来了解世界。他们会去一些地方，比如[华尔街日报](http://www.wsj.com/)了解保守派的观点，[沙龙](http://www.salon.com/)了解自由派的观点，[First Look Media](https://www.firstlook.org/)了解更激进的调查性新闻，他们甚至会关注[Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics)上的政治版块，以获得提供各种想象中的观点大杂烩。

## 2. You can have rational conversations with people you disagree with.

Critical thinkers are not afraid of a healthy debate. They believe that any opinion worth having should hold up to scrutiny, so they welcome conversations with people on the opposite side of the spectrum. While it is unlikely they will change their mind as a result of these discussions, they come away grateful for the opportunity to learn more about the thought process of their fellow man.

> 批判性思维者并不害怕有益辩论。他们认为，任何有价值的观点都应该经得起推敲，因此他们欢迎与持相反观点的人进行对话。虽然他们不可能因为这些讨论而改变自己的想法，但他们会因为有机会更多地了解自己同胞的思维过程而感激。

> healthy debate
> [词典]	坦率真诚地交换意见;
> [例句]Throughout the conference, there was healthy debate and dialog among the attendees.
> 在整个研讨会中，都是参与者之间的有益辩论和对话。

## 3. You are willing to change your mind when/if you discover you were wrong.

Critical thinkers know that it is impossible to be right about everything all the time. They’re open to the possibility that no, they don’t have it all figured it out; and when that happens, they are willing to admit it.

> 批判性思维的人知道，不可能对所有的事情的判断都是正确的，他们愿意接受这样的可能性：不，他们并没有完全想通；当这种情况发生时，他们愿意承认这一点。


## 4. You get irritated with people who resort to personal insults on comment threads.

Critical thinkers are often frustrated at the total lack of rationality that surrounds them on the Internet. While they aim to keep any conversation centered on the issue at hand, others inevitably resort to `ad hominem attacks` and personal attacks, an insulting tactic that makes a critical thinker want to slam the laptop shut and walk away.

> 批判性思维者常常对互联网上缺乏理性的一切感到沮丧。虽然他们的目的是让任何对话都围绕这个问题展开，但其他人则不可避免地诉诸于人身攻击，这种侮辱性的策略让批判性思维者想拍拍屁股走人。


## 5. You evolve as a person every single day.

Critical thinkers wake up every day, excited to have another opportunity to sharpen their thinking ability. They case aside the shackles of their ego, and wear an outfit of modesty, because they know they still have a lot to learn.

> 批判性思维的人每天醒来，都很兴奋，因为他们又有机会来磨练自己的思维能力。他们抛开自我的枷锁，穿上谦虚的衣服，因为自己还有很多东西要学。


## 6. You are fascinated by how things work.

Critical thinkers have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Their friends might accuse them of being bookworms, news junkies, or academic addicts; but they’re okay with that, because they wouldn’t trade their childlike curiosity for anything in the world.

> 批判性思维的人对知识有着难以抑制的渴求。他们的朋友可能会指责他们是书虫、新闻迷或学术上瘾者；但他们对此无所谓，因为他们不会用自己孩童般的好奇心去换取世界上的任何东西。

## 7. You have creative, innovative, original ideas.

Critical thinkers would rather innovate than regurgitate. They make a point to learn from the successes of others, but they execute original ideas that are anything but “predictable” or “conventional.”

> 批判性思维的人宁愿创新也不愿拾人牙慧（[rɪˈɡɜːrdʒɪteɪt）。 他们提出从他人的成功中吸取教训的观点，但他们执行的原始想法绝非“可预测的”或“传统的”。

> You can get sick to death of a friend *regurgitating* her partner's *opinions.*

> 对于一个只会机械地重复其搭档观点的朋友，你可能会无比腻烦。

While being a critical thinker is typically a plus, there can always be too much of a good thing. These final three signs you’re a critical thinker are some common pitfalls you should look out for.

## 8. You over-analyze issues that only require a simple solution.

Critical thinkers are sometimes guilty of turning a small problem into a bigger one. Their brain processes on a high level, searching for complex solutions to life’s complicated problems. The best solutions, however, are often the simple ones.

## 9. You expect too much of yourself.

Critical thinkers are typically confident (and rightfully so), but sometimes they forget that they are human just like everyone else (*and just in case you weren’t aware, being human means we are all inherently flawed)*. We all have those moments when we lose our senses or make a bad decision; being a critical thinker does not exempt you from this reality, but it does often amplify the stress that follows. Critical thinkers should [cultivate an attitude of patience ](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/8-ways-stay-calm-and-cool-how-more-patient-and-less-stressed.html)and [let go of their need for perfection](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/why-you-need-stop-demanding-perfection.html).

## 10. You do too much thinking, and not enough doing.

Critical thinkers would be wise to [develop the action habit](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/less-thinking-more-doing-develop-the-action-habit-today.html) in order to counterbalance their tendency to over-think. No matter how powerful your brain might be, it won’t do you any good if you’re not actively pursuing your ambitions.
