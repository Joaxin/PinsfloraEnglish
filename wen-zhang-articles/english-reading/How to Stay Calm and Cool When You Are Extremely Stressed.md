Being in a hurry all the time drains your energy. Your work and routine life make you feel overwhelmed. Getting caught up in things beyond your control stresses you out…

If you’d like to stay cool in stressful situations, here’s how stay calm in 8 quick steps:

## 1. Breathe

The next time you’re faced with a stressful situation that makes you want to hurry, stop what you’re doing for one minute and perform the following steps:

- Take five [deep breaths](https://www.lifehack.org/698475/deep-breathing-exercises-makes-you-a-better-parent) in and out (your belly should come forward with each inhale).
- Imagine all that stress leaving your body with each exhale.
- Smile. Fake it if you have to. It’s pretty hard to stay grumpy with a goofy grin on your face.

Feel free to repeat the above steps every few hours at work or home if you need to.

## 2. Loosen up

After your breathing session, perform a quick body scan to identify any areas that are tight or tense. Clenched jaw? Rounded shoulders? Anything else that isn’t at ease?

Gently touch or massage any of your body parts that are under tension to encourage total relaxation. It might help to imagine you’re in a place that calms you: a beach, hot tub, or nature trail, for example.

## 3. Chew Slowly

Slow down at the dinner table if you want to learn to be patient and lose weight. Shoveling your food down as fast as you can is a surefire way to eat more than you need to (and find yourself with a bellyache).

[Be a mindful eater](https://www.lifehack.org/788855/mindful-eating) who pays attention to the taste, texture, and aroma of every dish. Chew slowly while you try to guess all of the ingredients that were used to prepare your dish.

## 4. Let Go

Cliche as it sounds, it’s very effective.

The thing that seems like the end of the world right now?

It’s not. Promise.

Stressing and worrying about the situation you’re in won’t do any good because you’re already in it, so just let it go.

## 5. Enjoy the Journey

Focusing on the end result can quickly become exhausting.

## 6. Look at the Big Picture

The next time you find your stress level skyrocketing, take a deep breath, and ask yourself:

Will this matter to me…

- Next week?
- Next month?
- Next year?
- In 10 years?

Hint: No, it won’t.

I bet most of the stuff that stresses you wouldn’t matter the next week, maybe not even the next day.

Stop agonizing over things you can’t control because you’re only hurting yourself.

## 7. Stop Demanding Perfection of Yourself

You’re not perfect and that’s okay. Show me a person who claims to be perfect and I’ll show you a dirty liar.

Demanding perfection of yourself (or anybody else) will only stress you out because it just isn’t possible.

## 8. Practice Patience Every Day

> “Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.” — Saadi

Here’re a few easy ways you can practice patience every day, increasing your ability to remain calm and cool in times of stress:

- The next time you go to the grocery store, get in the longest line.
- Instead of going through the drive-thru at your bank, go inside.
- Take a long walk through a secluded park or trail.

## Final Thoughts

Staying calm in stressful situations is possible, all you need is some daily practice.

Taking deep breaths and eating mindfully are some simple ways to train your brain to be more patient. But changing the way you think of a situation and staying positive are most important in keeping cool whenever you feel overwhelmed and stressful.
