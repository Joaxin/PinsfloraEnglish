Curiosity might have killed the cat, but it could help you live a happier and more successful life. Curious people are not content to study a single subject of interest; instead, they learn about a wide array of topics that fascinate them. This gives them a fresh perspective that allows them to find answers to problems that others might miss. Curious people ask lots of questions and are determined to identify common threads that exist in conflicting topics \(_and it’s not difficult to see how that might lead to more success\)._ If you’d like to boost your ability to think creatively, apply these 5 ways to develop curiosity.

## 1. Eliminate “I’m Bored” from Your Vocabulary

> “I’m bored” is a useless thing to say. I mean, you live in a great, big, vast world that you’ve seen none percent of. Even the inside of your own mind is endless; it goes on forever, inwardly, do you understand? The fact that you’re alive is amazing, so you don’t get to say “I’m bored.” – Louis C.K.

The more you say you’re bored, the less opportunity your mind has to grow. If you look at something and find it boring, you’re not looking hard enough. Stuck in a waiting room and bored out of your mind? Grab a magazine you would never read otherwise and read an article that piques your interest. Strike up a conversation with a stranger and ask them to tell you an interesting story. Watch the mannerisms of the people around you and be fascinated by their personal quirks.

## 2. Search for the Positive in All Situations

> Positive thinking will let you do everything better than negative thinking will. – Zig Ziglar

If you expect something to be dreadfully boring, it will be. If you tell yourself you will have no fun, you won’t. Instead of agonizing during a traffic jam, take the opportunity to call a friend to catch up, or listen to a few chapters of a good audio-book. Expecting things to be fun and interesting will help you develop a positive mind-set that is more open to new ideas.

## 3. Question Everything

> The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. – Albert Einstein

Could you tell me why the sky is blue? Do you know what bugs are responsible for the insect chorus that sings when darkness falls? Have you ever wondered what your dog does at home while you’re working during the day? Why does it take us longer to begin a chore than it takes us to actually complete it? Pay more attention. Life is full of questions to ask. Live in the present and notice the things that fascinate you most. Solve the mysteries that you can’t stop thinking about.

## 4. Do Something Different

> We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing new things, because we’re curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths. – Walt Disney

Do you usually listen to hard rock while you work? Try to work while listening to smooth jazz, classical music, or R&B. Do you usually stick with self-help and autobiographies? Read a trashy romance novel or horror book. Do you usually stick with mainstream movies? Find an independent theater and watch a foreign film. You will never really know if you don’t like something until you give it a fair chance.

## 5. Conquer Fear

> Curiosity will conquer fear even more than bravery will. – James Stephens

Most people stick with the “same ol’, same ol'” because they are afraid to try something different. Change can be a scary thing when we become so used to a routine that we don’t even have to think about it. The more curious you are, the less afraid you will be. Focus on the positive outcomes when you try something new. For example, let’s say you are interested in theater arts, decided to audition for a play for the first time ever, got cast, and now it is opening night. Don’t think about how embarrassed you would be if you forgot your lines \(_hint: no one will ever notice as long as you don’t freak out\)._ Instead, imagine booming applause and a standing ovation at curtain call.
