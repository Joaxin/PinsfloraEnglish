# Mystery of the White Gardenia

Every year on my birthday, from the time I turned 12, a white gardenia\(栀子花\) was delivered to my house in Bethesda, Maryland. No card or note came with it. Calls to the florist\(花店\) were always in vain-it was a cash purchase. After a while I stopped trying to discover the sender's identity and just delighted in the beauty and heady perfume of that one magical,perfect white flower nestled in soft pink tissue paper.

打我十二岁那年起，每到过生日那天，都会有一朵白色的栀子花送到我在马里兰州贝塞斯达的家中。没有卡片，也无留言。我曾多次打电话询问花店老板，但每次都是徒劳，因为那是用现金支付的。一段时间后，我不再四处打听谁是赠花人，而是尽情欣赏着那朵用柔软的粉红色纸包着的纯白无比的栀子花，陶醉于它的美丽和馨香之中。

But I never stopped imagining who the anonymous giver might be. Some of my happiest moments were spent daydreaming about wonderful and exciting but shy or eccentric to make known his or her identity.

即便如此，我对那个匿名送花者的猜测却从未停止过。我的幸福时光，有时就是在一些异想天开中度过的。我猜测着，也许他是个令人惊奇而又兴奋的人，但碍于腼腆或是古怪的性情不肯让我知道他（她）到底是谁。

My mother contributed to these imaginings. She‘d ask me if there was someone for whom I had done a special kindness who might be showing appreciation. Perhaps the neighbor’s help when she was unloading a car full of groceries. Or maybe it was the old man across the street whose mail I retrieved during the winter so he wouldn‘t have to venture down his icy steps. As a teenager，though，I had more fun speculating that it might be a boy I had a crush on or one had noticed me even though I didn’t know him.

母亲的关心勾起了我这些想像\(其实，若不是母亲对此事的关心，我也许还不会有这么多的遐想\)。她总会问我，是不是我曾给过某人特殊的帮助，别人才会用这种方式向我表示谢意；或者是邻居？由于我曾帮她卸过满满一车的杂货；抑或是住在街对面的那个老人？因为在寒冬里我帮他取过信件，这样他就不必战栗地走下自家门前那结冰的台阶了。然而风华正茂的我，更喜欢推测赠花人是我喜欢的某个男孩子，或是我并不知晓但钟情于我的男孩子。

When I was 17, a boy broke my heart. The night he called for the last time, I cried myself to sleep. When I awoke in the morning, there was a message scribbled on my mirror in red lipstick: “Heartily know,when half gods go, the gods arrive“. I thought about that quotation from Emerson for a long time, and until my heart healed,went to get the glass cleaned,my mother knew everything was all right again.

 I don't remember ever slamming my door in anger at her and shouting:"You just don't understand!" because she did understand.

十七岁那年，我被一个男孩儿伤透了心。在他最后一次打电话给我的那天晚上，我含着泪睡着了。

第二天清晨醒来，我发现有人用口红在镜子上写道：“该走的终究会走，该来的一定会来。切记。”我默默地思考着爱默生的这句名言，并没有把母亲写下的这句话抹去。

当有一天我终于从镜子上抹去那几个字时，母亲知道一切又恢复正常。

我已忘记自己曾当她的面怒发冲冠“砰”地关上门，并冲她吼道：“你根本不了解！”而事实上我深知，正是因为她深深地了解这一切，我才会那个样子。

One month before my highschool graduation，my father died of a heart attack. My feelings ranged from grief to abandonment, fear and overwhelming anger that my dad was missing some of the most important events in my life. I became completely uninterested in my upcoming graduation， the senior class play and the prom. But my mother, in the midst of her own grief，would not hear of my skipping any of those things.

在我高中毕业前一个月，父亲心脏病发作永远地离开了我们。当时我的情绪波动很大，有时悲痛欲绝；有时自暴自弃，甚至非常气愤，因为父亲再也参加不了我一生中的某些最重要的活动了。那时，我对于即将到来的毕业典礼、毕业班的演出和班级舞会完全没了兴致。可母亲虽然也沉浸在悲痛之中，但她却坚决不让我错过学校的任何活动。。

The day before my father died,my mother and I had gone shopping for a prom dress. We'd found a spectacular one,with yards and yards of dotted swiss\(薄纱\)in red,white and blue,it made me feel like Scarlett O'Hara,but it was the wrong size. When my father died, I forgot about the dress.

My mother didn't. The day before the prom,I found that dress-in the right size-draped majestically over the living-room sofa. It wasn't just delivered,still in the box. It was presented to me-beautifully,artistically, lovingly. I didn't care if I had a new dress or not. But my mother did. I didn't care if I had a new dress or not. But my mother did.

父亲去世的前一天，我和母亲去买参加班级舞会穿的衣服。我们看中了一件很特别的薄纱礼服，上面印着有多红、白、蓝色的花点。穿着它，我感觉就像郝思嘉一样漂亮，只是有尺寸不合适。父亲去世后，我就忘记了衣服的事。

但母亲没有忘。舞会的前天，我发现那件衣服挂在起居室的沙发上方，端庄华美，而且尺寸也刚好合适。这是母亲特地送给我的——漂亮、高雅，惹人喜爱。我当时根本不在乎是否有新衣服，可母亲却很在意。

She wanted her children to feel loved and lovable， creative and imaginative， imbued with a sense that there was magic in the world and beauty in the face of adversity. In truth, my mother wanted her children to see themselves much like the gardenia—lovely, strong and perfect—with an aura of magic and perhaps a bit of mystery.

My mother died ten days after I was married， I was 22. That was the year the gardenias stopped coming.

母亲希望自己的孩子能够感受到爱，能够讨人喜欢并具有创造力和想象力，她还希望我能够感受到世间万物的魔力，在面对逆境时能够展现出别样的美丽。实际上，母亲希望自己的孩子能够像洁白的栀子花一样可爱、顽强且完美无瑕—有种魔幻的香味，或许还有那么一点神秘的色彩。

我结婚后的第十天，妈妈离开了人世，那年我二十二岁。从此，我就再没有收到过栀子花了。

一位母亲对女儿的无微不至的关怀就这样不着痕迹地体现在字里行间，这种人世间最纯洁、最无私的爱算不上轰轰烈烈，但是却最令人感动，最令人难忘。而触动感情防线的往往是那些生命中的细微部分，真情自然流淌，交融着爱的伟大与平凡。

父母对儿女的爱是世界上最神圣的爱，没有任何爱会超越它。在我们高兴时，他们会与我们一起分享；当我们沮丧时，他们会毫不犹豫地帮助我们；当我们进步时，掌声与鼓励会真诚地发自他们的心底；当我们痛苦时，他们更是毫无保留地替我们分担，这就是父母对儿女的爱。
